"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it annually consumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that labour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.

Ham on Rye,"“Wordsworth, Whitman, William Carlos Williams, and the Beats in their respective generations moved poetry toward a more natural language. Bukowski moved it a little farther.” –Los Angeles Times Book Review In what is widely hailed as the best of his many novels, Charles Bukowski details the long, lonely years of his own hardscrabble youth in the raw voice of alter ego Henry Chinaski. From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, woman, and the Los Angeles Public Library's collection of D.H.

Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Through classroom activities, wizard rock concerts, and organizations like the Harry Potter Alliance, Harry Potter fans are using creativity to positively impact the world. This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.",['Lisa S.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics),"Not that Hemingway was correct, but he did write in 1935: ""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn;” unless we are to interpret the adjective 'modern' as 'unadorned.' But Hemingway's remark somehow points to the importance of Mark Twain's breezy, fresh, and straight-forward style.Huckleberry Finn is a poor child whose only family is “Pap” —his abusive drunk father. Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he —a white author— imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes. But Mark Twain also threw other ethical dilemmas into the fray: It is right to obey wrong laws? Should the individual suffer to preserve society?Hence the universal importance of the book.To do honor to the original version, my editorial corrections are minimal. The language —including the dialects— have been left untouched, as well as terms today deemed offensive.",['Mark Twain' ' Marciano Guerrero'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+(Courage+Literary+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-27,http://books.google.com/books?id=xU7QoQEACAAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+(Courage+Literary+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],606,4.308580858085809,"Here are the tags that fit best:

I Capture the Castle,"“Every time I meet someone who also loves I Capture the Castle, I know we must be kindred spirits.” —from the new foreword by Jenny Han, the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. A beautiful, deluxe edition of Dodie Smith’s beloved novel, I Capture the Castle, featuring a new foreword by New York Times bestselling author Jenny Han, a stunning new cover, and designed endpapers that is perfect for devoted readers and those discovering this timeless story for the first time. Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that’s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn’t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever. Through Cassandra’s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle’s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has “captured the castle” – and the heart of the reader – in one of literature’s most enchanting novels. “This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.” —J.K.

Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club),"A New York Times Bestseller & Oprah's Book Club Pick Young Julie Harmon works “hard as a man,” they say, so hard that at times she’s not sure she can stop. People depend on her to slaughter the hogs and nurse the dying. People are weak, and there is so much to do. At just seventeen she marries and moves down into the valley of Gap Creek, where perhaps life will be better. But Julie and Hank’s new life in the valley, in the last years of the nineteenth century, is more complicated than the couple ever imagined. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what to fear most—the fires and floods or the flesh-and-blood grifters, drunks, and busybodies who insinuate themselves into their new life. To survive, they must find out whether love can keep chaos and madness at bay. Their struggles with nature, with work, with the changing century, and with the disappointments and triumphs of their union make Gap Creek a timeless story of a marriage.",['Robert Morgan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MpDqIm6nAsAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MpDqIm6nAsAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gap+Creek:+The+Story+Of+A+Marriage+(Oprah%27s+Book+Club)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Algonquin Books,2012-08-21,http://books.google.com/books?id=MpDqIm6nAsAC&dq=Gap+Creek:+The+Story+Of+A+Marriage+(Oprah%27s+Book+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],328,3.7378048780487805,"Here are the chosen tags:

"Slaughterhouse-five: Or, The children's crusade : a duty-dance with death","A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Slaughterhouse-five:+Or,+The+children%27s+crusade+:+a+duty-dance+with+death&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999-01-12,"http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Slaughterhouse-five:+Or,+The+children%27s+crusade+:+a+duty-dance+with+death&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Fiction'],835,4.325748502994012,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book:

With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,"“Eugene Sledge became more than a legend with his memoir, With The Old Breed. He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific—the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary—into terms we mortals can grasp.”—Tom Hanks NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In The Wall Street Journal, Victor Davis Hanson named With the Old Breed one of the top five books on epic twentieth-century battles. Studs Terkel interviewed the author for his definitive oral history, The Good War. Now E. B. Sledge’s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation. An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B. Sledge became part of the war’s famous 1st Marine Division—3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where “the world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.” By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic. Based on notes Sledge secretly kept in a copy of the New Testament, With the Old Breed captures with utter simplicity and searing honesty the experience of a soldier in the fierce Pacific Theater. Here is what saved, threatened, and changed his life. Here, too, is the story of how he learned to hate and kill—and came to love—his fellow man. “In all the literature on the Second World War, there is not a more honest, realistic or moving memoir than Eugene Sledge’s. This is the real deal, the real war: unvarnished, brutal, without a shred of sentimentality or false patriotism, a profound primer on what it actually was like to be in that war. It is a classic that will outlive all the armchair generals’ safe accounts of—not the ‘good war’—but the worst war ever.”—Ken Burns",['E.B. Sledge'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kfgnHCLvQPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kfgnHCLvQPcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=With+the+Old+Breed:+At+Peleliu+and+Okinawa&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Presidio Press,2008-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kfgnHCLvQPcC&source=gbs_api,['History'],654,4.91131498470948,"Here are the chosen tags:

Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed,"Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus. In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror. An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End. Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim. And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun. He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene. Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel. But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death. Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer. In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history. Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert. It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she. Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate. She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press. Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created. New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include: - How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...",['Patricia Cornwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C3TUKNroaYkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=C3TUKNroaYkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portrait+of+a+Killer:+Jack+the+Ripper+-+Case+Closed&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2002-11-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=C3TUKNroaYkC&dq=Portrait+of+a+Killer:+Jack+the+Ripper+-+Case+Closed&hl=&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],529,2.5803402646502835,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book:

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich - 2 Volumes Eastern Press Leather (A History of Nazi Germany),"The legendary CBS news journalist’s selection of iconic World War II radio broadcasts from countries throughout Europe. William L. Shirer was the first journalist hired by CBS to cover World War II in Europe, and he worked there for over a decade as a news broadcaster. This book compiles two and a half years’ worth of wartime broadcasts from Shirer’s time on the ground during World War II. He was with Nazi forces when Hitler invaded Austria and made it a part of Germany under the Anchluss; he was also the first to report back to the United States on the armistice between France and Nazi forces in June of 1940. His daily roundup of news from Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and London, which documented Nazi Germany and the conditions of countries under invasion and at war, became famous for its gripping urgency. Shirer brought a sense of immediacy to the war for listeners in the United States and worldwide, and his later books, including the seminal Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, became definitive works on World War II history. This collection of Shirer’s radio broadcasts offers all the original suspense and vivid storytelling of the time, bringing World War II to life for a modern audience.",['William L.

This bestselling modern classic, reissued with a beautiful new cover design, is a story for people who want to follow their dreams and make their own rules and has inspired people for decades. `Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight how to get from shore to food and back again,' writes author Richard Bach in this allegory about a unique bird named Jonathan Livingston Seagull. `For most gulls it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.' Flight is indeed the metaphor that makes this story soar. This bestselling modern classic is a fable about seeking a higher purpose in life, even if your flock, tribe or neighbourhood finds your ambition threatening (at one point our beloved gull is even banished from his flock).

On the surface, this is a horrifying tale of colonial exploitation. The narrator, Marlowe journeys on business deep into the heart of Africa. But there he encounters Kurtz, an idealist apparently crazed and depraved by his power over the natives, and the meeting prompts Marlowe to reflect on the darkness at the heart of all men. This short but complex and often ambiguous story, which has been the basis of several films and plays, continues to provoke interpretation and discussion.",['Joseph Conrad'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9MW4QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9MW4QgAACAAJ&dq=Heart+of+Darkness+(Everyman+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Everyman Chess,1993-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=9MW4QgAACAAJ&dq=Heart+of+Darkness+(Everyman+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Africa'],538,4.089219330855019,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Finnegan's Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics.

Economics in one lesson (Pocket book),"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&pg=PP1&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson+(Pocket+book)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Currency,2010-08-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],629,4.378378378378378,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Outsiders,"Celebrate the 50th anniversary (April, 2017) of a landmark coming-of-age American novel with a Penguin Classics edition featuring an introduction by Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister's Keeper. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read First published in 1967, S. E. Hinton's novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today, with more than eight million copies sold, The Outsiders continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship. In Ponyboy's world there are two types of people. There are the Socs, the rich society kids who get away with anything. Then there are the greasers, like Ponyboy, who aren't so lucky. Ponyboy has a few things he can count on: his older brothers, his friends, and trouble with the Socs, whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. At least he knows what to expect-until the night things go too far. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The Fellowship of the Ring,"Begin your journey into Middle-earth... The inspiration for the upcoming original series on Prime Video, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power—the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring—the ring that rules them all—which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.",['J.R.R.

We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book),"Moving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering. The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls. It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile -- physical or spiritual -- but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing. Profoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core. Rarely has a writer made such a startling and inspiring statement about the value of hope and compassion. ""What keeps us coming back to Oates Country is her uncanny gift of making the page a window, with something happening on the other side that we'd swear was like life itself"". -- The New York Times Book Review ""A major achievement that stands with Oates' finest studies of American life...the novel is a testament to the tenacious bonds of the family, therestorative power of love and capacity to endure and prevail"". -- The Chicago Tribune",['Joyce Carol Oates'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=F84fAAAACAAJ&dq=We+Were+the+Mulvaneys+(A+William+Abrahams+Book)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1996-09-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=F84fAAAACAAJ&dq=We+Were+the+Mulvaneys+(A+William+Abrahams+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api,None,379,3.2638522427440635,"Here are the chosen tags:

Twenty Thousand leagues Under the Sea,"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+Thousand+leagues+Under+the+Sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,None,322,4.124223602484472,"Here are the chosen tags:

Hatchet,"Celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Newbery Honor–winning survival novel Hatchet with a pocket-sized edition perfect for travelers to take along on their own adventures. This special anniversary edition includes a new introduction and commentary by author Gary Paulsen, pen-and-ink illustrations by Drew Willis, and a water resistant cover. Hatchet has also been nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson, haunted by his secret knowledge of his mother’s infidelity, is traveling by single-engine plane to visit his father for the first time since the divorce. When the plane crashes, killing the pilot, the sole survivor is Brian. He is alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had given him as a present. At first consumed by despair and self-pity, Brian slowly learns survival skills—how to make a shelter for himself, how to hunt and fish and forage for food, how to make a fire—and even finds the courage to start over from scratch when a tornado ravages his campsite. When Brian is finally rescued after fifty-four days in the wild, he emerges from his ordeal with new patience and maturity, and a greater understanding of himself and his parents.",['Gary Paulsen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QdX94z_OoukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QdX94z_OoukC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hatchet&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2009-08-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QdX94z_OoukC&source=gbs_api,['Juvenile Fiction'],1264,4.397151898734177,"Here are the chosen tags:

Cannery Row,"Steinbeck's tough yet charming portrait of people on the margins of society, dependant on one another for both physical and emotional survival Published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is: both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual. Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed…and, at the darkest level…the terror of isolation and nothingness.” For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.

OF MICE AND MEN,"A controversial tale of friendship and tragedy during the Great Depression A Penguin Classic Over seventy-five years since its first publication, Steinbeck’s tale of commitment, loneliness, hope, and loss remains one of America’s most widely read and taught novels. An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as “a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today’s leading Steinbeck scholars. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['John Steinbeck'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=OF+MICE+AND+MEN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1994-02-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&dq=OF+MICE+AND+MEN&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],938,4.37953091684435,"Here are the chosen tags:

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,"The Phantom of the Opera is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. Christine Daaé travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the ""Angel of Music"", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with ""Mamma"" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her ""a little bit of heaven's music"". The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically deformed and mentally disturbed musical genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera house. He is in love with Christine.",['Gaston Leroux'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+PHANTOM+OF+THE+OPERA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BookRix,2019-06-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kBK0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],366,4.502732240437158,"Here are the tags that fit best for ""The Phantom of the Opera"":

Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood,"Garnering a vast amount of attention from young people and parents, and from book buyers across the country, Smashed became a media sensation and a New York Times bestseller. Eye-opening and utterly gripping, Koren Zailckas’s story is that of thousands of girls like her who are not alcoholics—yet—but who routinely use booze as a shortcut to courage and a stand-in for good judgment. With one stiff sip of Southern Comfort at the age of fourteen, Zailckas is initiated into the world of drinking. From then on, she will drink faithfully, fanatically. In high school, her experimentation will lead to a stomach pumping. In college, her excess will give way to a pattern of self-poisoning that will grow more destructive each year. At age twenty-two, Zailckas will wake up in an unfamiliar apartment in New York City, elbow her friend who is passed out next to her, and ask, ""Where are we?"" Smashed is a sober look at how she got there and, after years of blackouts and smashups, what it took for her to realize she had to stop drinking. Smashed is an astonishing literary debut destined to become a classic.",['Koren Zailckas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=86uLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=86uLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Smashed:+Story+of+a+Drunken+Girlhood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2006-01-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=86uLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Smashed:+Story+of+a+Drunken+Girlhood&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],458,3.6812227074235806,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood"":

The Bonfire of the Vanities,"An exhilarating satire of Eighties excess that captures the effervescent spirit of New York, from one of the greatest writers of modern American prose. Sherman McCoy is a WASP, bond trader and self-appointed 'Master of the Universe'. He has a fashionable wife, a Park Avenue apartment and a Southern mistress. His spectacular fall begins the moment he is involved in a hit-and-run accident in the Bronx. Prosecutors, newspaper hacks, politicians and clergy close in on him, determined to bring him down. Exuberant, scandalous and exceptionally discerning, The Bonfire of the Vanities was Tom Wolfe's first venture into fiction and cemented his reputation as the foremost chronicler of his age.

Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics.

The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,"The unique feature of this book is its down-to-earth practicality Here you are presented with simple, usable techniques and formulas, which you can easily apply in your workaday world. I have taught these simple processes to men and women all over the world, and recently over a thousand men and women of all religious affiliations attended a special class in Los Angeles where I presented the highlights of what is offered in the pages of this book. Many came from distances of two hundred miles for each class lesson. The special features of this book will appeal to you because they show you why oftentimes you get the opposite of what you prayed for and reveal to you the reasons why. People have asked me in all parts of the world and thousands of times, ?Why is it I have prayed and prayed and got no answer?? In this book you will find the reasons for this common complaint. The many ways of impressing the subconscious mind and getting the right answers make this an extraordinarily valuable book and an ever present help in time of trouble.",['Joseph Murphy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hWdvDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hWdvDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Power+of+Your+Subconscious+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd,2017-03-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWdvDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],466,4.358369098712446,"Here are the chosen tags:

1984,"Nieuwspraak, Big Brother, het vocabulaire uit 1984 is in onze taal opgenomen en een eigen leven gaan leiden. De roman van George Orwell uit 1949 over de strijd van Winston Smith, ambtenaar op het ministerie van Waarheid, tegen de alles doordringende Partij, en zijn gedoemde liefde voor Julia heeft niets van zijn literarie zeggingskracht verloren. In Orwells steeds weer herdrukte anti-utopie verkeert de wereld in de wurggreep van een systeem dat is gegrondvest op de verbreiding van angst, haat en wreedheid, en dat iedere vorm van persoonlijke vrijheid en indiviualiteit uitsluit. 1984 is onverminderd geldig als benauwend nauwkeurig blauwdruk van elk dictatoriaal regime.",['George Orwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gTx1AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gTx1AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=1984&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Singel Uitgeverijen,2013-05-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gTx1AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2936,4.580040871934605,"Here are the chosen tags:

Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time 08),"The Wheel of Time is now an original series on Prime Video, starring Rosamund Pike as Moiraine! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The Seanchan invasion force is in possession of Ebou Dar. Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha head for Caemlyn and Elayne's rightful throne, but on the way they discover an enemy much worse than the Seanchan. In Illian, Rand vows to throw the Seanchan back as he did once before. But signs of madness are appearing among the Asha'man. In Ghealdan, Perrin faces the intrigues of Whitecloaks, Seanchan invaders, the scattered Shaido Aiel, and the Prophet himself. Perrin's beloved wife, Faile, may pay with her life, and Perrin himself may have to destroy his soul to save her. Meanwhile the rebel Aes Sedai under their young Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere, face an army that intends to keep them away from the White Tower. But Egwene is determined to unseat the usurper Elaida and reunite the Aes Sedai. She does not yet understand the price that others--and she herself--will pay.

"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang, The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam","New York Times Bestseller: A “powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read” (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered—sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up—creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway—the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting—interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable. It reveals to us, as rarely before, man’s most heroic and horrendous endeavor.",['Harold G. Moore' ' Joseph L.

Sense and sensibility,"Jane Austen's first published work, meticulously constructed and sparkling with her unique wit Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love. This edition also includes explanatory notes and textual variants between first and second edition. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Moloka'i,"Young Rachel Kalama, growing up in idyllic Honolulu in the 1890s, is part of a big, loving Hawaiian family, and dreams of seeing the far-off lands that her father, a merchant seaman, often visits. But at the age of seven, Rachel and her dreams are shattered by the discovery that she has leprosy. Forcibly removed from her family, she is sent to Kalaupapa, the isolated leper colony on the island of Moloka'i. In her exile she finds a family of friends to replace the family she's lost: a native healer, Haleola, who becomes her adopted ""auntie"" and makes Rachel aware of the rich culture and mythology of her people; Sister Mary Catherine Voorhies, one of the Franciscan sisters who care for young girls at Kalaupapa; and the beautiful, worldly Leilani, who harbors a surprising secret. At Kalaupapa she also meets the man she will one day marry. True to historical accounts, Moloka'i is the story of an extraordinary human drama, the full scope and pathos of which has never been told before in fiction. But Rachel's life, though shadowed by disease, isolation, and tragedy, is also one of joy, courage, and dignity. This is a story about life, not death; hope, not despair. It is not about the failings of flesh, but the strength of the human spirit.",['Alan Brennert'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aAaDtgwDTS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aAaDtgwDTS4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moloka%27i&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2010-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAaDtgwDTS4C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],444,4.481981981981982,"Here are the tags that fit best:

"The Beatles - A Hard Day's Night [Non-US Format, PAL, Region 2, Import - Great Britain]","Zomer 2011. Adolf Hitler wordt wakker op een verlaten veld in Berlijn. Zonder oorlog, zonder partij, zonder Eva. Hij dwaalt rond in een volstrekt onherkenbare stad en al wie hij aanspreekt denkt dat hij een hilarische, sarcastische imitator is. In die hoedanigheid wordt Hitler een hype en begint hij zesenzestig jaar na zijn vermeende overlijden aan een televisiecarriere. Timur Vermes heeft een van de grappigste boeken van de laatste jaren geschreven. Hij neemt de media en de cynische massa genadeloos op de korrel zonder aan spanning in te boeten.

Gone with the Wind,"'My dear, I don't give a damn.' Margaret Mitchell’s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years. Beloved and thought by many to be the greatest of the American novels, Gone with the Wind is a story of love, hope and loss set against the tense historical background of the American Civil War. The lovers at the novel’s centre – the selfish, privileged Scarlett O’Hara and rakish Rhett Butler – are magnetic: pulling readers into the tangled narrative of a struggle to survive that cannot be forgotten.

"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","""Fascinating.... Lays a foundation for understanding human history.""—Bill Gates In this ""artful, informative, and delightful"" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Me Talk Pretty One Day C,"A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child.

When an uprising in Baskul forces a small group of English and American residents to flee, their plane crash-lands in the far western reaches of the Tibetan Himalayas. There, the bewildered party finds themselves stranded outside the protective borders of the British Empire, and discovers access to a place beyond the bounds of the imagination—a legendary paradise, the mystic monastery Shangri-La.

America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It,"It's the end of the world as we know it... Someday soon, you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin. Europeans already are. And liberals will still tell you that ""diversity is our strength""--while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops, the Supreme Court decides sharia law doesn't violate the ""separation of church and state,"" and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy. If you think this can't happen, you haven't been paying attention, as the hilarious, provocative, and brilliant Mark Steyn--the most popular conservative columnist in the English-speaking world--shows to devastating effect. The future, as Steyn shows, belongs to the fecund and the confident. And the Islamists are both, while the West is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization. But America can survive, prosper, and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself, in the sturdier virtues of self-reliance (not government), in the centrality of family, and in the conviction that our country really is the world's last best hope. Mark Steyn's America Alone is laugh-out-loud funny--but it will also change the way you look at the world.",['Mark Steyn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fag2c5iEIHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fag2c5iEIHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=America+Alone:+The+End+of+the+World+as+We+Know+It&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2008-04-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fag2c5iEIHwC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],601,4.4891846921797,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It"" by Mark Steyn:

Anne Frank the Diary of a Young Girl,"Anne Frank hield van 12 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 een dagboek bij. Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. ""Eén enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven. Misschien moet dat ook zo zijn: als we het leed van alle mensen moesten en konden meelijden, zouden we niet kunnen leven.""

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"From the #1 bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, the landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making. In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blink:+The+Power+of+Thinking+Without+Thinking&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Back Bay Books,2007-04-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],2851,3.696597685022799,"Here are the chosen tags:

This luminous story begins in the present day, when a professor invites a colleague to his home to see a painting that he has kept secret for decades. The professor swears it is a Vermeer—but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work’s inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner’s hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives. Susan Vreeland’s characters remind us, through their love of this mysterious painting, how beauty transforms and why we reach for it, what lasts and what in our lives is singular and unforgettable. “Vreeland’s book is a work of art.” —New York Post",['Susan Vreeland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Girl+in+Hyacinth+Blue&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,RosettaBooks,2012-03-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CVAqAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],402,3.990049751243781,"Here are the chosen tags:

Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Library Edition),"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+Thousand+Leagues+Under+the+Sea+(Library+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,None,328,4.1310975609756095,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Plainsong,"National Book Award Finalist A heartstrong story of family and romance, tribulation and tenacity, set on the High Plains east of Denver. In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether. A teenage girl—her father long since disappeared, her mother unwilling to have her in the house—is pregnant, alone herself, with nowhere to go. And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known. From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.",['Kent Haruf'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YRxPSGS5eq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YRxPSGS5eq0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Plainsong&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2001-04-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YRxPSGS5eq0C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],784,3.9693877551020407,"Here are the tags that fit best:

The Little Friend,"The second novel by Donna Tartt, bestselling author of The Goldfinch (winner of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize), The Little Friend is a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil. The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi, where one Mother’s Day a little boy named Robin Cleve Dufresnes was found hanging from a tree in his parents’ yard. Twelve years later Robin’s murder is still unsolved and his family remains devastated. So it is that Robin’s sister Harriet—unnervingly bright, insufferably determined, and unduly influenced by the fiction of Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson--sets out to unmask his killer. Aided only by her worshipful friend Hely, Harriet crosses her town’s rigid lines of race and caste and burrows deep into her family’s history of loss. Filled with hairpin turns of plot and “a bustling, ridiculous humanity worthy of Dickens” (The New York Times Book Review), The Little Friend is a work of myriad enchantments by a writer of prodigious talent.",['Donna Tartt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V1bcluI9HlgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=V1bcluI9HlgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Little+Friend&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-10-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V1bcluI9HlgC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],442,2.8959276018099547,"Here are the chosen tags:

"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","The Wheel of Time ® is a PBS Great American Read Selection! Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit. Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul. At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower. In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.

My Friend Leonard,"Perhaps the most unconventional and literally breathtaking father-son story you'll ever read, My Friend Leonard pulls you immediately and deeply into a relationship as unusual as it is inspiring. The father figure is Leonard, the high-living, recovering coke addict ""West Coast Director of a large Italian-American finance firm"" (read: mobster) who helped to keep James Frey clean in A Million Little Pieces. The son is, of course, James, damaged perhaps beyond repair by years of crack and alcohol addiction-and by more than a few cruel tricks of fate. James embarks on his post-rehab existence in Chicago emotionally devastated, broke, and afraid to get close to other people. But then Leonard comes back into his life, and everything changes. Leonard offers his ""son"" lucrative—if illegal and slightly dangerous—employment. He teaches James to enjoy life, sober, for the first time. He instructs him in the art of ""living boldly,"" pushes him to pursue his passion for writing, and provides a watchful and supportive veil of protection under which James can get his life together. Both Leonard's and James's careers flourish…but then Leonard vanishes. When the reasons behind his mysterious absence are revealed, the book opens up in unexpected emotional ways. My Friend Leonard showcases a brilliant and energetic young writer rising to important new challenges—displaying surprising warmth, humor, and maturity—without losing his intensity. This book proves that one of the most provocative literary voices of his generation is also one of the most emphatically human.",['James Frey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KunTApO0QL8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KunTApO0QL8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=My+Friend+Leonard&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2005-06-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KunTApO0QL8C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],419,3.8973747016706444,"Here are the chosen tags:

Tobacco Road,"Originally published in 1932, Caldwell's novel told the story of the Lester family, poor Georgia sharecroppers who no longer farmed the land, but lived by whatever means possible. Caldwell's picture of the rural South challenged notions of the dignified and polite Antebellum South and depicted an image that was grotesque, violent, and morally bankrupt.

The Exorcist,"Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist, one of the most controversial novels ever written, went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying. Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark. Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",['William Peter Blatty'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akGyuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=akGyuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Exorcist&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper,2011-10-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=akGyuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Exorcist&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],362,4.5911602209944755,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Old Man & the Sea,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of Poison Flower: a retired intelligence officer is caught in “[a] harrowing hunt-and-hide adventure” (The New York Times). To all appearances, Dan Chase is a harmless retiree in Vermont with two big mutts and a grown daughter he keeps in touch with by phone. But most sixty-year-old widowers don’t have multiple driver’s licenses, savings stockpiled in banks across the country, or two Beretta Nanos stashed in the spare bedroom closet. Most have not spent decades on the run. Thirty-five years ago, as a young army intelligence hotshot, Chase was sent to Libya to covertly assist a rebel army. When the plan turned sour, Chase acted according to his conscience—and triggered consequences he never could have anticipated. To this day, someone still wants him dead. And just when he thought he was finally safe, Chase is confronted with the history he spent much of his life trying to escape. “Perry drives deep into Jack Reacher territory in this stand-alone [novel] . . .

WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE . . . AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY),"New York Times Bestseller: A “powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read” (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered—sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up—creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway—the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting—interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable. It reveals to us, as rarely before, man’s most heroic and horrendous endeavor.",['Harold G. Moore' ' Joseph L.

Creepers,"CREEPERS, David Morrell's gripping joyride of a thriller, depicts every harrowing second in eight hours of relentless terror. A New York Times bestseller, it received the prestigious Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association. On a cold October night, five people gather in a run-down motel on the New Jersey shore and begin preparations to break in to the Paragon Hotel. Built in the glory days of Asbury Park by a reclusive millionaire, the magnificent structure—which foreshadowed the beauties of art-deco architecture—is now boarded up and marked for demolition. The five people are ""creepers,"" the slang term for urban explorers: city archeologists with a passion for investigating abandoned buildings and their dying secrets. On this evening, they are joined by a reporter who wants to profile them—anonymously, as this is a highly illegal activity—for a New York Times article. Frank Balenger isn't looking for just a story, however. And after the group enters the rat-infested tunnel leading to the hotel, it becomes clear that he will get much more than he bargained for. Danger, terror, and death await the creepers in a place ravaged by time and redolent of evil. The darkest secrets live in places you’re not supposed to be. “Chilling.” —Stephen King, New York Times bestselling author of Doctor Sleep “Crack this novel, and it’s like an alien abduction of your brain—forget resuming your normal life until it’s finished. This will be a classic.”—Douglas Preston, New York Times bestselling co-author (with Lincoln Child) of White Fire “With its nonstop cascade of ingeniously contrived dangers and assaults, culminating in an apocalyptic finale, Creepers provides the essence of all thrillers, an intense emotional effect that will leave readers drained.”—Washington Post",['David Morrell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Creepers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,David Morrell ,2011-06-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],471,3.7579617834394905,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Creepers"" by David Morrell:

Middlesex [Unabridged Audiobook],"Spanning eight decades and chronicling the wild ride of a Greek-American family through the vicissitudes of the twentieth century, Jeffrey Eugenides’ witty, exuberant novel on one level tells a traditional story about three generations of a fantastic, absurd, lovable immigrant family -- blessed and cursed with generous doses of tragedy and high comedy. But there’s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie’s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator’s life in motion. Middlesex is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It’s a brilliant exploration of divided people, divided families, divided cities and nations -- the connected halves that make up ourselves and our world.",['Jeffrey Eugenides'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Middlesex+%5BUnabridged+Audiobook%5D&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage Canada,2011-07-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=rUHHbYhlIxYC&dq=Middlesex+%5BUnabridged+Audiobook%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1015,4.289655172413793,"Here are the chosen tags:

Up from slavery: An autobiography,"In this acclaimed autobiography, Booker T. Washington makes a case for lifting up his race through education. Washington uses his personal story as the example, from his birth to slave parents on a Virginia plantation and his struggle to go to school to his adult achievements as a public speaker and black leader. Washington outlines more than forty years of his life, emphasizing how he overcame great obstacles in order to pursue his education at Hampton University. As an adult, he opened a school for black students in Tuskegee, Alabama, and later he established other successful vocational schools. Throughout the book, Washington describes his educational philosophy and his hopes and dreams for African Americans. This is an unabridged version of Booker T. Washington's life story, which was first published in 1901.",['Booker T.

Moby-Dick or the Whale,"Call me Ishmael. So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), ""Bartelby the Scrivener"" (1853), ""Benito Cerino"" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).",['H.

Moby Dick or the White Whale,"Moby Dick is a novel by American writer Herman Melville. The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it ""the greatest book of the sea ever written."" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: ""Unforgettable phrases abound."" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, ""Call me Ishmael,"" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.",['Herman Melville'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moby+Dick+or+the+White+Whale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BookRix,2022-02-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],451,4.126385809312638,"Here are the chosen tags:

Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism,"The hard-hitting and provocative first book from the fastest-rising conservative voice in the country Sean Hannity is the hottest phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel’s Hannity & Colmes has made him one of the network’s most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio’s The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted conservative following, and ensured his place alongside Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly as one of the country’s most influential commentators. Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world—political, social, and cultural—as he sees it. Drawing on stories from his own life, and on the inspiration of political figures like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, he recounts the experiences that have shaped his perspective on the dramatic issues that face America today: • Terrorism and National Security • The Economy • Liberal Media Bias • Education • Faith, Character, and the Family As America meets the challenges of the post-9/11 world—abroad and at home—Sean Hannity’s position is clear: “We are engaged in a war of ideas.

The Quiet American,"I have asked permission to dedicate this book to you not only in memory of the hagpy evenings I have spent with you in Saigon over the last five years, but also because I have quite shamelessly borrowed the location of your flat to house one of iny characters, and your name, Phuong, for the convenience of readers because it is simple, beautiful and easy to pronounce, which is not true of all your couiftry- women’s names. You will both realise I have borrowed little else, certainly not the characters of anyone in Viet Nam. Pyle, Granger, Fowler, Vigot, Joe— these have had no originals in the life of Saigon or Hanoi, and General The is dead : shot in the back, so thfcy say. Even the historical events have been rearranged. For example, the big bomb near the Continental preceded and did not follow the bicycle bombs. I have no scruples about such small changes. This is a story and not a piece of history, and I hope that as a story about a few imaginary characters it will pass for both of you one hot Saigon evening.",['Graham Greene'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5HBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=B5HBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Quiet+American&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prabhat Prakashan,2021-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B5HBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],888,4.385135135135135,"Here are the chosen tags:

Emma (Radio Collection),"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Girls comes an eagerly anticipated story collection exploring the dark corners of human experience. ""A thrilling new voice in American fiction.""--Jennifer Egan, about The Girls An absentee father collects his son from boarding school after a shocking act of violence. A nanny to a celebrity family hides out in Laurel Canyon in the aftermath of a tabloid scandal. A young woman sells her underwear to strangers. A notorious guest arrives at a placid, not-quite rehab in the Southwest. In ten remarkable stories, Emma Cline portrays moments when the ordinary is disturbed, when daily life buckles, revealing the perversity and violence pulsing under the surface. She explores characters navigating the edge, the limits of themselves and those around them: power dynamics in families, in relationships, the distance between their true and false selves. They want connection, but what they provoke is often closer to self-sabotage. What are the costs of one's choices? Of the moments when we act, or fail to act? These complexities are at the heart of Daddy, Emma Cline's sharp-eyed illumination of the contrary impulses that animate our inner lives.",['Emma Cline'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T3n1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=T3n1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emma+(Radio+Collection)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2020-09-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=T3n1DwAAQBAJ&dq=Emma+(Radio+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],411,4.2749391727493915,"Here are the chosen tags:

As a man thinketh,"Complete Brand New Edition - As a Man Thinketh -By James Allen. James Allen (28 November 1864 – 24 January 1912) was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and poetry and as a pioneer of the self-help movement. As a Man Thinketh is a literary essay which has been mass-produced since its publication in 1902. It has been a source of inspiration to motivational and self-help authors.The title is influenced by a verse in the Bible from the Book of Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7: “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” While the passage suggests that one should consider the true motivations of a person who is being uncharacteristically generous before accepting his generosity, the title and content of Allen's work refer to the reader himself.This book, written in terms of the responsibility assumption, opens with the statement: Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes, And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills, Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills: He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass: Environment is but his looking-glass.",['Associate Professor of Philosophy James Allen' ' James Allen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lz_3ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lz_3ngEACAAJ&dq=As+a+man+thinketh&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CreateSpace,2014-02-11,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lz_3ngEACAAJ&dq=As+a+man+thinketh&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],400,4.585,"Here are the chosen tags:

48 Laws of Power,"THE MILLION COPY INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER Drawn from 3,000 years of the history of power, this is the definitive guide to help readers achieve for themselves what Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, Louis XIV and Machiavelli learnt the hard way. Law 1: Never outshine the master Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends; learn how to use enemies Law 3: Conceal your intentions Law 4: Always say less than necessary. The text is bold and elegant, laid out in black and red throughout and replete with fables and unique word sculptures. The 48 laws are illustrated through the tactics, triumphs and failures of great figures from the past who have wielded - or been victimised by - power. ___________________________________ (From the Playboy interview with Jay-Z, April 2003) PLAYBOY: Rap careers are usually over fast: one or two hits, then styles change and a new guy comes along. Why have you endured while other rappers haven't? JAY-Z: I would say that it's from still being able to relate to people. It's natural to lose yourself when you have success, to start surrounding yourself with fake people. In The 48 Laws of Power, it says the worst thing you can do is build a fortress around yourself. I still got the people who grew up with me, my cousin and my childhood friends. This guy right here (gestures to the studio manager), he's my friend, and he told me that one of my records, Volume Three, was wack.

But in the thick of motherhood's exhausting early days, Blythe becomes convinced that something is wrong with her daughter—she doesn't behave like most children do. Or is it all in Blythe's head? Her husband, Fox, says she's imagining things. The more Fox dismisses her fears, the more Blythe begins to question her own sanity, and the more we begin to question what Blythe is telling us about her life as well. Then their son Sam is born—and with him, Blythe has the blissful connection she'd always imagined with her child. Even Violet seems to love her little brother. But when life as they know it is changed in an instant, the devastating fall-out forces Blythe to face the truth. The Push is a tour de force you will read in a sitting, an utterly immersive novel that will challenge everything you think you know about motherhood, about what we owe our children, and what it feels like when women are not believed.",['Ashley Audrain'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4LZPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4LZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Push:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2021-01-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=4LZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Push:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],592,4.155405405405405,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Push: A Novel"" by Ashley Audrain:

The Color of Water,"Lieveheersvogel is een opmerkelijk en tot de verbeelding sprekend boek, geschreven door de opvallend veelzijdige auteur James McBride. Het is een geweldige combinatie van geschiedenis en verbeeldingskracht, geschreven met een nauwkeurig gevoel voor detail en personages. Slavenzoon en wees Henry Shackleford is gedwongen te vluchten en wordt aan de vooravond van de Amerikaanse burgeroorlog opgenomen in het gezelschap van John Brown, een militant voorstander van de afschaffing van de slavernij. Henry wordt door de blanke Brown voor een meisje aangezien. Hoewel hij zich in eerste instantie schaamt, ziet hij al gauw de voordelen van zijn nieuwe identiteit en vrijheid. Het verhaal van Lieveheersvogel ontspint zich rondom deze twee onvergetelijke karakters tijdens een cruciaal moment in de Amerikaanse geschiedenis, waarin de afschaffing van de slavernij centraal staat. McBride diept met lef, humor en gevoel dit pijnlijke onderwerp uit en biedt een nieuw perspectief op deze beslissende periode.",['James McBride'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hPoSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hPoSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Color+of+Water&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Karakter,2014-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hPoSBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],479,4.457202505219207,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Caddie Woodlawn,"An illustrated edition of the Newberry Medal–winning Caddie Woodlawn, which has been captivating young readers since 1935. Caddie Woodlawn is a real adventurer. She'd rather hunt than sew and plow than bake, and tries to beat her brother's dares every chance she gets. Caddie is friends with Indians, who scare most of the neighbors—neighbors who, like her mother and sisters, don't understand her at all. Caddie is brave, and her story is special because it's based on the life and memories of Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother, the real Caddie Woodlawn. Her spirit and sense of fun have made this book a classic that readers have taken to their hearts for more than seventy years.",['Carol Ryrie Brink'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1uYXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1uYXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Caddie+Woodlawn&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Aladdin,2006-12-26,http://books.google.com/books?id=1uYXEAAAQBAJ&dq=Caddie+Woodlawn&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Juvenile Fiction'],333,4.414414414414415,"Here are the tags that fit best:

To kill a mockingbird,"Voted America's Best-Loved Novel in PBS's The Great American Read Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.",['Harper Lee'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PGR2AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PGR2AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+kill+a+mockingbird&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2014-07-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PGR2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3337,4.600539406652682,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"":

Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In,"In één avond verdwijnen vier jonge kinderen op mysterieuze wijze in Moonlight Bay, maar vanuit de politie blijft het stil. Wat is er hier aan de hand? Christopher Snow is de enige die het donkere kwaad aan het daglicht kan brengen. Door een zeldzame ziekte kan hij zonlicht niet verdragen en leeft hij zijn leven wanneer iedereen slaapt. Hij besluit in het holst van de nacht op zoek te gaan naar de vermiste kinderen in de donkere kelders van Fort Wyvern. Er gaan geruchten dat hier ondraaglijke experimenten worden uitgevoerd. Is hij opgewassen tegen de gevaren van genetische manipulatie? De horrorthriller ‘Grijp de nacht’ is het tweede verhaal over Christopher Snow, waarmee bestsellerauteur Dean Koontz je opnieuw de stuipen op het lijf weet te jagen. Moonlight Bay is een onafgeronde trilogie van Dean Koontz. Christopher Snow, een man met een bijzondere genetische huidziekte, onderzoekt mysterieuze gebeurtenissen rond de fictieve Californische plaats Moonlight Bay. Liefhebbers van de eerste twee boeken wachten al sinds het jaar 2000 op het derde deel in de serie, dat half af zou zijn, maar moeten het vooralsnog met twee delen stellen: Vrees niets en Grijp de nacht. De Amerikaanse auteur Dean Ray Koontz (1945) staat bekend om zijn spannende thrillers die vaak een vleugje horror, fantasy, science fiction of satire bevatten. Veel van zijn werken bereikten de New York Times-bestsellerlijst, waarvan meerdere direct op nummer één binnenkwamen. Dit maakt hem tot een van de grootste New York Times-bestsellerauteurs ter wereld. In totaal heeft hij maar liefst 105 boeken geschreven waarvan er meer dan zestig in het Nederlands te lezen zijn. Zijn boeken zijn wereldwijd meer dan 500 miljoen keer verkocht.",['Dean R.

Tess of the D'Urbervilles,"A heartbreaking portrayal of a woman faced by an impossible choice in the pursuit of happiness When Tess Durbeyfield is driven by family poverty to claim kinship with the wealthy D'Urbervilles and seek a portion of their family fortune, meeting her 'cousin' Alec proves to be her downfall. A very different man, Angel Clare, seems to offer her love and salvation, but Tess must choose whether to reveal her past or remain silent in the hope of a peaceful future. With its sensitive depiction of the wronged Tess and powerful criticism of social convention, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, subtitled ""A Pure Woman,"" is one of the most moving and poetic of Hardy's novels.

The Pact: A Love Story,"“Engrossing...The Pact is compelling reading.”—People In this heart-rending tale of love and friendship, Jodi Picoult brings to life a familiar world, and in a single terrifying moment awakens every parent’s worst fear: We think we know our children . . . but do we ever really know them at all? The Golds and the Hartes, neighbors for eighteen years, have always been inseparable. So have their children—and it’s no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily’s friendship blossoms into something more. But the bonds of family, friendship, and passion—which had seemed so indestructible—suddenly threaten to unravel in the wake of unimaginable tragedy. When midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the truth. Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head. There’s a single unspent bullet in the gun that Chris pilfered from his father’s cabinet—a bullet that Chris tells police he intended for himself. But a local detective has doubts about the suicide pact that Chris describes. This extraordinary, poignant novel paints an indelible portrait of two families in anguish . . . and creates an astonishingly suspenseful courtroom drama as Chris is put on trial for murder.",['Jodi Picoult'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TmRmk64eP-EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TmRmk64eP-EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Pact:+A+Love+Story&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TmRmk64eP-EC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1035,4.2898550724637685,"Here are the chosen tags:

A Death in the Family,"A storm-struck island. A blood-soaked bed. A missing man. In this captivating mystery that's perfect for fans of Knives Out, Senior Investigator Shana Merchant discovers that murder is a family affair. Thirteen months ago, former NYPD detective Shana Merchant barely survived being abducted by a serial killer. Now hoping to leave grisly murder cases behind, she's taken a job in her fiancé's sleepy hometown in the Thousand Islands region of Upstate New York. But as a nor'easter bears down on her new territory, Shana and fellow investigator Tim Wellington receive a call about a man missing on a private island. Shana and Tim travel to the isolated island owned by the wealthy Sinclair family to question the witnesses. They arrive to find blood on the scene and a house full of Sinclair family and friends on edge. While Tim guesses they're dealing with a runaway case, Shana is convinced that they have a murder on their hands. As the gale intensifies outside, she starts conducting interviews and discovers the Sinclairs and their guests are crawling with dark and dangerous secrets. Trapped on the island by the raging storm with only Tim whose reliability is thrown into question, the increasingly restless suspects, and her own trauma-fueled flashbacks for company, Shana will have to trust the one person her abduction destroyed her faith in—herself. But time is ticking down, because if Shana's right, a killer is in their midst and as the pressure mounts, so do the odds that they'll strike again.",['Tessa Wegert'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wRaZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wRaZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Death+in+the+Family&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2020-02-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wRaZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],399,4.130325814536341,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Appropriate ""reader friendly"" type sizes have been chosen for each title—offering clear, accurate, and readable text. All editions are complete and unabridged, and feature Introductions and Afterwords. This edition of The Scarlet Letter includes a Preface, Biographical Note, and Afterword by Keith Neilson. The Puritans thought Hester Prynne's crime was unforgivable. She was convicted, imprisoned--and then forced to wear, forever, a public reminder of her sin. The Scarlet letter.

"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","From the New York Times bestselling author of Band of Brothers and D-Day, the definitive book on Lewis and Clark’s exploration of the Louisiana Purchase, the most momentous expedition in American history and one of the great adventure stories of all time. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years. Next comes Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched Jefferson’s. There are numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century. High adventure, high politics, suspense, drama, and diplomacy combine with high romance and personal tragedy to make this outstanding work of scholarship as readable as a novel.",['Stephen E.

The Dante Club,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Before The Dante Chamber, there was The Dante Club: “an ingenious thriller that . . . brings Dante Alighieri’s Inferno to vivid, even unsettling life.”—The Boston Globe “With intricate plots, classical themes, and erudite characters . . . what’s not to love?”—Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code and Origin Boston, 1865. The literary geniuses of the Dante Club—poets and Harvard professors Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell, along with publisher J. T. Fields—are finishing America’s first translation of The Divine Comedy. The powerful Boston Brahmins at Harvard College are fighting to keep Dante in obscurity, believing the infiltration of foreign superstitions to be as corrupting as the immigrants arriving at Boston Harbor. But as the members of the Dante Club fight to keep a sacred literary cause alive, their plans fall apart when a series of murders erupts through Boston and Cambridge. Only this small group of scholars realizes that the gruesome killings are modeled on the descriptions of Hell’s punishments from Dante’s Inferno. With the lives of the Boston elite and Dante’s literary future in the New World at stake, the members of the Dante Club must find the killer before the authorities discover their secret. Praise for The Dante Club “Ingenious . . . [Matthew Pearl] keeps this mystery sparkling with erudition.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times “Not just a page-turner but a beguiling look at the U.S. in an era when elites shaped the course of learning and publishing. With this story of the Dante Club’s own descent into hell, Mr. Pearl’s book will delight the Dante novice and expert alike.”—The Wall Street Journal “[Pearl] ably meshes the . . . literary analysis with a suspenseful plot and in the process humanizes the historical figures. . . . A divine mystery.”—People (Page-turner of the Week) “An erudite and entertaining account of Dante’s violent entrance into the American canon.”—Los Angeles Times “A hell of a first novel . . . The Dante Club delivers in spades. . . . Pearl has crafted a work that maintains interest and drips with nineteenth-century atmospherics.”—San Francisco Chronicle",['Matthew Pearl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6mVVupLeQYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=S6mVVupLeQYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Dante+Club&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2004-02-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=S6mVVupLeQYC&dq=The+Dante+Club&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],346,3.621387283236994,"Here are the chosen tags:

"The great divorce,","What if anyone in Hell could take a bus trip to Heaven and stay there forever if they wanted to? In The Great Divorce C. S. Lewis again employs his formidable talent for fable and allegory. The writer finds himself in Hell boarding a bus bound for Heaven. The amazing opportunity is that anyone who wants to stay in Heaven, can. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil, grace and judgment. Lewis's revolutionary idea is the discovery that the gates of Hell are locked from the inside.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Referring to ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, "" H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was ""the most stupendous event of my whole life""; Ernest Hemingway declared that ""all modern American literature stems from this one book,"" while T. S. Eliot called Huck ""one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet."" The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: ""natural"" man versus ""civilized"" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget.

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"National Book Award Winner: The definitive account of Nazi Germany and “one of the most important works of history of our time” (The New York Times). When the Third Reich fell, it fell swiftly. The Nazis had little time to destroy their memos, their letters, or their diaries. William L. Shirer’s sweeping account of the Third Reich uses these unique sources, combined with his experience living in Germany as an international correspondent throughout the war. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich earned Shirer a National Book Award and continues to be recognized as one of the most important and authoritative books about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany ever written. The diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, as well as evidence and other testimony gained at the Nuremberg Trials, could not have found more artful hands. Shirer gives a clear, detailed, and well-documented account of how it was that Adolf Hitler almost succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a chilling and illuminating portrait of mankind’s darkest hours. “A monumental work.” —Theodore H. White",['William L.

MOBY DICK or THE WHALE,"Call me Ishmael. So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), ""Bartelby the Scrivener"" (1853), ""Benito Cerino"" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).",['H.

Carrie,"Carrie van Stephen King is het bloedstollende verhaal over Carrie White, een buitenbeentje met een godsdienstwaanzinnige moeder, dat al twee keer werd verfilmd. Carrie heeft nooit de goede kleren aan, is niet goed in spelletjes en is altijd de laatste die de grap begrijpt. En dus wordt ze het mikpunt van alle treiterijen. Maar Carrie is geen normaal meisje. Als ze wil, kan ze dingen laten bewegen met haar gedachten. Het is een zonde, vindt haar moeder, daarom maakt ze het haar geheime spelletje. Ze kan knikkers laten dansen, kaarsen omgooien, deuren op slot doen. Dan komt uit onverwachte hoek een vriendelijk gebaar. Een van de meisjes heeft spijt van haar aandeel aan de pesterijen en vraagt haar vriendje, een van de populaire jongens, om Carrie mee te vragen naar het schoolfeest. Dit valt in slechte aarde bij de grootste pestkop van de klas die het Carrie niet gunt, en ze bedenkt een afschuwelijke wraakactie. Carries droom wordt werkelijkheid, om vervolgens op het hoogtepunt compleet aan gruzelementen te vallen. Dan slaan bij Carrie alle stoppen door... Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers. Zijn recentste boeken zijn Gevangen, 22-11-1963, Joyland, Dr. Sleep, Mr. Mercedes, De eerlijke vinder en De bazaar van boze dromen.

"20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea","The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=20,+000+Leagues+Under+the+Sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,None,316,4.1075949367088604,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"":

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"When Connecticut mechanic and foreman Hank Morgan is knocked unconscious, he wakes not to the familiar scenes of nineteenth-century America but to the bewildering sights and sounds of sixth-century Camelot. Although confused at first and quickly imprisoned, he soon realises that his knowledge of the future can transform his fate. Correctly predicting a solar eclipse from inside his prison cell, Morgan terrifies the people of England into releasing him and swiftly establishes himself as the most powerful magician in the land, stronger than Merlin and greatly admired by Arthur himself. But the Connecticut Yankee wishes for more than simply a place at the Round Table. Soon, he begins a far greater struggle: to bring American democratic ideals to Old England. Complex and fascinating, A Connecticut Yankee is a darkly comic consideration of the nature of human nature and society.

Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night—with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get her a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not it’s worth the price of her soul.",['Lauren Weisberger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ppqvXkmGKj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ppqvXkmGKj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Devil+Wears+Prada&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2003-04-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ppqvXkmGKj0C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],861,2.986062717770035,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Daughter of Time,"Voted greatest mystery novel of all time by the Crime Writers' Association in 1990, Josephine Tey recreates one of history's most famous--and vicious--crimes in her classic bestselling novel, a must read for connoisseurs of fiction. Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard, recuperating from a broken leg, becomes fascinated with a contemporary portrait of Richard III that bears no resemblance to the Wicked Uncle of history. Could such a sensitive, noble face actually belong to one of the world's most heinous villains--a venomous hunchback who may have killed his brother's children to make his crown secure? Or could Richard have been the victim, turned into a monster by the usurpers of England's throne? Grant determines to find out once and for all, with the help of the British Museum and an American scholar, what kind of man Richard Plantagenet really was and who killed the Little Princes in the Tower. The Daughter of Time is an ingeniously plotted, beautifully written, and suspenseful tale, a supreme achievement from one of mystery writing's most gifted masters.",['Josephine Tey'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=d85kzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Daughter+of+Time&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2021-03-25,http://books.google.nl/books?id=d85kzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Daughter+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api,None,428,4.373831775700935,"Here are the chosen tags:

In the Heart of the Sea : The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,"From the author of Mayflower, Valiant Ambition, and In the Hurricane's Eye--the riveting bestseller tells the story of the true events that inspired Melville's Moby-Dick. Winner of the National Book Award, Nathaniel Philbrick's book is a fantastic saga of survival and adventure, steeped in the lore of whaling, with deep resonance in American literature and history. In 1820, the whaleship Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale, leaving the desperate crew to drift for more than ninety days in three tiny boats. Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents and vivid details about the Nantucket whaling tradition to reveal the chilling facts of this infamous maritime disaster.

Hannibal,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Is it as good as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? No . . . this one is better.”—Stephen King, The New York Times Book Review You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal. Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he’s been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter’s world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward. . . . Praise for Hannibal “Interested in getting the hell scared out of you? Buy this book on a Friday . . . lock all doors and windows. And by Monday , you might just be able to sleep without a night-light.”—Newsday “Strap yourself in for one heck of a ride. . . . It’ll scare your socks off.”—Denver Post “A stunner . . . writing in language as bright and precise as a surgeon’s scalpel, Harris has created a world as mysterious as Hannibal’s memory palace and as disturbing as a Goya painting. This is one book you don’t want to read alone at night.”—The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “Relentless . . . endlessly terrifying . . . 486 fast-paced pages, in which every respite is but a prelude to further furious action . . . Hannibal begins with a murderous paroxysm that leaves the reader breathless. . . . Hannibal speaks to the imagination, to the feelings, to the passions, to exalted senses and to debased ones. Harris’s voice will be heard for a while.”—Los Angeles Times “A pleasurable sense of dread.”—The Wall Street Journal “Enormously satisfying . . . a smashing good time, turning the pages for thrills, chills, horror and finally, a bracing, deliciously wicked slap in the face . . . perhaps the very best the thriller/horror genre is capable of producing.”—San Diego Union-Tribune",['Thomas Harris'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N8mOeVOPzasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N8mOeVOPzasC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hannibal&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dell,2009-06-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N8mOeVOPzasC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1253,3.1827613727055066,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Seat of the Soul,"The anniversary edition of this beloved bestseller is celebrated in Prefaces by Oprah Winfrey and Maya Angelou and contains a new Foreword by the author, website links, and a new Study Guide to help readers find even deeper meaning and fulfillment. The Seat of the Soul encourages you become the authority in your own life. It will change the way you see the world, interact with other people, and understand your own actions and motivations. Beginning with evolution, Gary Zukav takes you on a penetrating exploration of the new phase humanity has entered: we are evolving from a species that understands power as the ability to manipulate and control—external power—into a species that understands power as the alignment of the personality with the soul—authentic power. Our evolution requires each of us to make the values of the soul our own: harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for Life. Using his scientist’s eye and philosopher’s heart, Zukav shows us how to participate fully in this evolution, enlivening our everyday activities and all of our relationships with meaning and purpose. The Seat of the Soul has sold millions of copies around the globe, and as it changes lives, more and more people begin to live by the values of the spirit. Indeed, a new world is emerging, and this book brings its message to you.",['Gary Zukav'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B3FKm4Q8ARMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=B3FKm4Q8ARMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Seat+of+the+Soul&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2007-06-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B3FKm4Q8ARMC&source=gbs_api,['Body' ' Mind & Spirit'],305,3.7442622950819673,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Nineteen Eighty-four,"'Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past' Hidden away in the Record Department of the sprawling Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith skilfully rewrites the past to suit the needs of the Party. Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.",['George Orwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h7BUNAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=h7BUNAEACAAJ&dq=Nineteen+Eighty-four&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin Classics,2013-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=h7BUNAEACAAJ&dq=Nineteen+Eighty-four&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Totalitarianism'],1475,4.578305084745763,"Here are the chosen tags:

Me Talk Pretty One Day,"A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child. Entertainment Weekly on Barrel Fever Sidesplitting Not one of the essays in this new collection failed to crack me up; frequently I was helpless.

Moby-Dick or The Whale,"Moby-Dick is one of the great epics in all of literature. Captain Ahab's hunt for the white whale drives the narrative at a relentless pace, while Ishmael's meditations on whales and whaling, on the sublime indifference of nature, and on the grimy physical details of the extraction of oil provide a reflective counterpoint to the headlong idolatrous quest. Sometimes read as a terrifying study of monomania or as a critical inquiry into the effects of reducing life to symbols, Moby-Dick also offers colorful and often comic glimpses of life aboard a whaling ship. For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life an essay on the text, and notes.",['Herman Melville'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moby-Dick+or+The+Whale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2002-12-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],456,4.131578947368421,"Here are the chosen tags:

Stranger in a Strange Land : ( Science Fiction Book Club Ltd Edition ),"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him. Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars. Now, connected by an incredible bond, Smith, Jill and a writer named Jubal must fight to protect a right we all take for granted: the right to love.",['Robert A.

Slaughter-House Five (First paperback edition),"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Slaughter-House+Five+(First+paperback+edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999-01-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Slaughter-House+Five+(First+paperback+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],828,4.329710144927536,"Here are the tags that fit best:

The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"From international bestseller Stephen King, a classic story that engages our emotions on the most primal level, a fairy tale grimmer than Grimm but aglow with a girl’s indomitable spirit. What if the woods were full of them? And of course they were, the woods were full of everything you didn’t like, everything you were afraid of and instinctively loathed, everything that tried to overwhelm you with nasty, no-brain panic. The brochure promised a “moderate-to-difficult” six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, where nine-year-old Trisha McFarland was to spend Saturday with her older brother Pete and her recently divorced mother. When she wanders off to escape their constant bickering, then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut through the woods, Trisha strays deeper into a wilderness full of peril and terror. Especially when night falls. Trisha has only her wits for navigation, only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fear. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games and the gritty performances of her hero, number thirty-six, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio’s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her—her key to surviving an enemy known only by the slaughtered animals and mangled trees in its wake.",['Stephen King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8MTqKDAsgpwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8MTqKDAsgpwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Girl+Who+Loved+Tom+Gordon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,1999-07-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8MTqKDAsgpwC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],522,3.9080459770114944,"Here are the tags that fit best:

On the Road,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE • A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this ""tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful"" (San Francisco Chronicle). A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, ""each the other's world entire,"" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.",['Cormac McCarthy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=On+the+Road&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2007-03-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],701,3.891583452211127,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""On the Road"" by Cormac McCarthy:

The Once and Future King,"Arthur, de koning van eens en ooit staat samen met Tolkiens In de ban van de ring aan de wieg van het fantasy-genre. Waar Tolkien een eigen universum schiep, baseerde zijn tijdgenoot White zich op de legende van koning Arthur en zijn ridders van de Ronde Tafel. White maakte een vrije bewerking van het verhaal, waarbij hij de schijnwerper ook richt op Arthurs vrouw Guinevere en zijn vriend, de onverslaanbare Lancelot. Whites eigen ongelukkige jeugd, problematische liefdes en dito vriendschappen kwamen hem bij het schetsen van hun driehoeksverhouding goed van pas. De schrijver permitteerde zich een cruciale ingreep in de oude legende: hij ruimde maar liefst tweehonderd pagina’s in voor het opgroeien van de vondeling Arthur. Als een Harry Potter avant la lettre beleeft de jongen onder leiding van tovenaar Merlijn vele leerzame avonturen in het dierenrijk. Het doel van deze opmerkelijke educatie: de wereld verlossen van het Recht van de Sterkste, de wortel van alle kwaad. Arthur bedenkt een Ronde Tafel, waar alle ridders die aanzitten gelijk zullen zijn. Met goede werken hoopt hij de ongepolijste vechtjassen in het gareel te houden. Maar dan begaat hij zelf een onvergeeflijke fout... In deze nieuwe vertaling komt de queeste van Arthur op liefdevolle, humoristische, hartstochtelijke, pijnlijke en ten slotte hartverscheurende wijze opnieuw tot leven.",['T.H.

All quiet on the western front;,"Considered by many the greatest war novel of all time, All Quiet on the Western Front is Erich Maria Remarque’s masterpiece of the German experience during World War I. I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. . . . This is the testament of Paul Bäumer, who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty, culture, and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive. “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”—The New York Times Book Review",['Erich Maria Remarque'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NR8qAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NR8qAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=All+quiet+on+the+western+front%3B&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,1996-09-29,http://books.google.com/books?id=NR8qAAAAQBAJ&dq=All+quiet+on+the+western+front%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],427,4.494145199063232,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Maria Remarque:

Mysterious Affair at Styles,"Agatha Christie’s first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was the result of a dare from her sister Madge who challenged her to write a story. The story begins when Hastings is sent back to England from the First World War due to injury and is invited to spend his sick leave at the beautiful Styles Court by his old friend John Cavendish. Here, Hastings meets John’s stepmother, Mrs. Inglethorp, and her new husband, Alfred. Despite the tranquil surroundings Hastings begins to realize that all is not right. When Mrs. Inglethorp is found poisoned, suspicion falls on the family, and another old friend, Hercule Poirot, is invited to investigate. Agatha Christie’s first-ever murder mystery. With impeccable timing, Hercule Poirot, the renowned Belgian detective, makes his dramatic entrance onto the English crime stage. Recently, there had been some strange goings-on at Styles St Mary. Evelyn, the constant companion to old Mrs. Inglethorp, had stormed out of the house muttering something about ‘a lot of sharks’. And with her, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt security; now the air seemed rife with suspicion and impending evil. A shattered coffee cup, a splash of candle grease, a bed of begonias... all Poirot required to display his now legendary powers of detection.",['Agatha Christie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mysterious+Affair+at+Styles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BEYOND BOOKS HUB,1975-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],372,4.193548387096774,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Treasure Island,"Treasure Island, published in 1883, popularized the now familiar characters of pirates and brought them to rum-swilling life. When an old sailor named Billy Bones dies in the inn belonging to young Jim Hawkins’s parents, he leaves a greasy old map on which an “X” marks the spot where treasure is buried. Jim joins the crew of a ship in pursuit of Bones’s treasure, and on the seas meets up with Long John Silver, a peg-legged pirate who has infiltrated their ranks.

Cat's Cradle,"“A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . .

Atlantis Found,"Clive Cussler sends his great hero on an explosive mission in Atlantis Found, the fifteenth Dirk Pitt adventure. Around the world ancient artefacts are suddenly appearing, hinting at a catastrophe that will soon visit Earth ... Dirk Pitt is on hand at a Colorado archaeological site where an ancient and mysterious artefact has been found - one that is perhaps linked to other strange objects turning up across the globe. And soon Pitt's skills and ingenuity are desperately needed to rescue the team after a suspicious explosion seals them deep underground. It quickly becomes clear that the artefacts carry a message: warning of global Armageddon. Yet a shadowy organisation called the Fourth Empire not only wants to stop others from heeding that warning, but is also actively seeking to accelerate the end it foretells. Now Pitt and NUMA must face this diabolical foe, who will stop at nothing to wipe out all life on earth ... Packed with blistering action and hair-raising suspense, Atlantis Found is Clive Cussler at his brilliant best. Atlantis Found is the fifteenth of Clive Cussler's bestselling Dirk Pitt thrillers - the series that also includes Arctic Drift and, his first novel, Mayday - in which the discovery of an artefact could mean the end of the world.

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable,"In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.",['Patrick M.

A place where you will meet Aslan, the bravest of lions, and a beautiful but wicked Witch. There are lots of other fabulous creatures too: giants and dwarfs and animals that talk. It all begins when four children -- Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy -- discover a strange old wardrobe. Stepping inside, they find that it's stranger still, because behind all the fur coats there is a wondrous land of trees and mountains, all glistening with snow. The White Witch has spread an icy winter everywhere. Only Aslan can defeat her and reverse her wicked spell. The children must find the lion before it is too late. If they fail, the Witch will make them her prisoners forever.

Good to Great,"The Challenge Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap. “Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,” comments Jim Collins, ""fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.” Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?",['Jim Collins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&dq=Good+to+Great&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperBusiness,2001-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DDOmWaG4qtQC&dq=Good+to+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],993,4.387713997985902,"Here are the chosen tags:

Disgrace: Complete & Unabridged,"J.M. Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Set in post-apartheid South Africa, J. M. Coetzee’s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. But when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced. Lurie pursues his relationship with the young Melanie—whom he describes as having hips “as slim as a twelve-year-old’s”—obsessively and narcissistically, ignoring, on one occasion, her wish not to have sex. When Melanie and her father lodge a complaint against him, Lurie is brought before an academic committee where he admits he is guilty of all the charges but refuses to express any repentance for his acts. In the furor of the scandal, jeered at by students, threatened by Melanie’s boyfriend, ridiculed by his ex-wife, Lurie is forced to resign and flees Cape Town for his daughter Lucy’s smallholding in the country. There he struggles to rekindle his relationship with Lucy and to understand the changing relations of blacks and whites in the new South Africa. But when three black strangers appear at their house asking to make a phone call, a harrowing afternoon of violence follows which leaves both of them badly shaken and further estranged from one another. After a brief return to Cape Town, where Lurie discovers his home has also been vandalized, he decides to stay on with his daughter, who is pregnant with the child of one of her attackers. Now thoroughly humiliated, Lurie devotes himself to volunteering at the animal clinic, where he helps put down diseased and unwanted dogs. It is here, Coetzee seems to suggest, that Lurie gains a redeeming sense of compassion absent from his life up to this point. Written with the austere clarity that has made J. M. Coetzee the winner of two Booker Prizes, Disgrace explores the downfall of one man and dramatizes, with unforgettable, at times almost unbearable, vividness the plight of a country caught in the chaotic aftermath of centuries of racial oppression.",['J.

The Last Templar,"The first thrilling novel in Raymond Khoury’s New York Times bestselling Templar series. In 1291, a young Templar knight flees the fallen holy land in a hail of fire and flashing sword, setting out to sea with a mysterious chest entrusted to him by the Order's dying grand master. The ship vanishes without a trace. In present day Manhattan, four masked horsemen dressed as Templar Knights stage a bloody raid on the Metropolitan Museum of Art during an exhibit of Vatican treasures. Emerging with a strange geared device, they disappear into the night. The investigation that follows draws archaeologist Tess Chaykin and FBI agent Sean Reilly into the dark, hidden history of the crusading knights—and into a deadly game of cat and mouse with ruthless killers—as they race across three continents to recover the lost secret of the Templars.",['Raymond Khoury'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=exq8mdbP9aIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=exq8mdbP9aIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Last+Templar&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2006-01-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=exq8mdbP9aIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],378,2.5846560846560847,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Doomsday Book,"Five years in the writing by one of science fiction's most honored authors, Doomsday Book is a storytelling triumph. Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering and the indomitable will of the human spirit. For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone. For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received. But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin—barely of age herself—finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours. Praise for Doomsday Book “A stunning novel that encompasses both suffering and hope. . . . The best work yet from one of science fiction’s best writers.”—The Denver Post “Splendid work—brutal, gripping and genuinely harrowing, the product of diligent research, fine writing and well-honed instincts, that should appeal far beyond the normal science-fiction constituency.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “The world of 1348 burns in the mind’s eye, and every character alive that year is a fully recognized being. . . . It becomes possible to feel . . . that Connie Willis did, in fact, over the five years Doomsday Book took her to write, open a window to another world, and that she saw something there.”—The Washington Post Book World",['Connie Willis'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lS7ipesDYFUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lS7ipesDYFUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Doomsday+Book&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Spectra,2011-01-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lS7ipesDYFUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],429,3.836829836829837,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Great Divorce,"What if anyone in Hell could take a bus trip to Heaven and stay there forever if they wanted to? In The Great Divorce C. S. Lewis again employs his formidable talent for fable and allegory. The writer finds himself in Hell boarding a bus bound for Heaven. The amazing opportunity is that anyone who wants to stay in Heaven, can. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil, grace and judgment. Lewis's revolutionary idea is the discovery that the gates of Hell are locked from the inside. In Lewis's own words, ""If we insist on keeping Hell (or even earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.""",['C.

Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.

"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","Call me Ishmael. So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), ""Bartelby the Scrivener"" (1853), ""Benito Cerino"" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).",['H.

Confessions of an Economic Hitman,"Shocking Bestseller: The original version of this astonishing tell-all book spent 73 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has sold more than 1.25 million copies, and has been translated into 32 languages. New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else—to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs—bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others—“con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.",['John Perkins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Confessions+of+an+Economic+Hitman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2016-02-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p2vgCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],907,3.564498346196251,"Here are the chosen tags:

Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass First published in 1845, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an eye-opening depiction of American slavery. Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write—a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America’s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write. It was a crime punishable by death, but it resulted in one of the most eloquent indictments of slavery ever recorded. His gripping narrative takes us into the fields, cabins, and manors of pre–Civil War plantations in the South and reveals the daily terrors he suffered. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Written more than a century and a half ago by a Black man who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age. It is a record of savagery and inhumanity that goes far to explain why America still suffers from the great injustices of the past.

Darkfever (Fever Series),"MacKayla Lane’s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks . . . until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death—a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed–a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .

Twenty thousand leagues under the sea,"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+thousand+leagues+under+the+sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,None,652,4.128834355828221,"Here are the chosen tags:

Stanger in a Strange Land,"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived... Born on the doomed spaceship and raised by the Martians who saved his life, Valentine Michael Smith has never seen a human being until the day a second expedition to Mars discovers him.

The haunting of Hill House,"The greatest haunted house story ever written, the inspiration for a 10-part Netflix series directed by Mike Flanagan and starring Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, and Timothy Hutton First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a “haunting”; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

The Pearl,"“There it lay, the great pearl, perfect as the moon.” A Penguin Classic One of Steinbeck’s most taught works, The Pearl is the story of the Mexican diver Kino, whose discovery of a magnificent pearl from the Gulf beds means the promise of a better life for his impoverished family. His dream blinds him to the greed and suspicions the pearl arouses in him and his neighbors, and even his loving wife Juana cannot temper his obsession or stem the events leading to tragedy. This classic novella from Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck examines the fallacy of the American dream, and illustrates the fall from innocence experienced by people who believe that wealth erases all problems.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Referring to ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, "" H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was ""the most stupendous event of my whole life""; Ernest Hemingway declared that ""all modern American literature stems from this one book,"" while T. S. Eliot called Huck ""one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet."" The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: ""natural"" man versus ""civilized"" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget.

Zélie kan zich de nacht dat ze toe moest kijken hoe de handlangers van de koning haar moeder ophingen nog levendig herinneren. Sindsdien is magie een doodzonde en een donkere huid iets om op neer te kijken. Tien jaar later krijgt Zélie de kans om de magie terug te brengen naar Orïsha. Met de hulp van een prinses op de vlucht, moet ze uit handen zien te blijven van Inan, de kroonprins, die vastbesloten is de magie nu voorgoed uit te bannen.

Life is a whirl of ball gowns and blow-dries (which inevitably take waaay too long, because hairdressers always need to talk through their addictions). But, strictly entre nous, it can actually be très draining to mix parties, peach bellinis and private jets ('PJs' to those fluent in globetrotting) while maintaining a standout collection of Chloé jeans and a job.

Lord of the Flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight” and one of the foremost classics of war literature. For Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades, is attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of a guerilla leader’s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, For Whom the Bell Tolls stands as one of the best war novels ever written.",['Ernest Hemingway'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-08IVs9NR14C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-08IVs9NR14C&q=For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls&dq=For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Scribner,1995-07-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=-08IVs9NR14C&dq=For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],297,4.353535353535354,"Here are the chosen tags:

Congo,"Als Dirk-Jan Koch bij Buitenlandse Zaken aangeeft dat hij graag in Congo geplaatst wil worden, krijgt hij direct een telefoontje van de personeelsdienst dat zijn wens gehonoreerd wordt. Kinshasa is voor diplomaten minder populair dan Kopenhagen, terwijl juist in Congo het avontuur lonkt. Als gepromoveerde ontwikkelingsdeskundige weet Koch precies welke ondersteuning de Congolezen nodig zouden hebben. Maar gaandeweg zijn reizen per uitgeholde boomstam over de Congo-rivier en op de motor diep de oerwouden in, komt hij erachter dat wat hij als internationale samenwerking ziet, Congolezen als internationale tegenwerking zien. Hij begint te doceren aan de universiteit van Kinshasa en samen met slimme studenten onderzoekt hij de schaduwkanten van de hulp. Uiteindelijk zegt hij zijn baan bij de ambassade op om als directeur aan de slag te gaan bij een organisatie waarin hij gelooft. In De Congo Codes concludeert Dirk-Jan Koch dat internationale samenwerking soms veel effectiever is dan we durven dromen, maar dat de effecten soms ook veel desastreuzer zijn dan we ons kunnen voorstellen. Het is vooral internationale desinteresse die ervoor zorgt dat Congo niet vooruit komt. Met dit persoonlijke en positieve relaas wakkert hij het debat aan over wat wij aan dit grote menselijke drama kunnen en moeten doen. Dirk-Jan Koch (1980) was op zijn zestiende al voorzitter van het Landelijk Aktie Komitee Scholieren (laks). Hij was als diplomaat werkzaam in Congo en als docent verbonden aan de Katholieke Universiteit van Kinshasa. Momenteel is hij directeur van Search for Common Ground, een internationale organisatie gericht op conflicttransformatie.",['Dirk Jan Koch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eYgpAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eYgpAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Congo&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prometheus,2014-03-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eYgpAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],284,3.8028169014084505,"Here are the chosen tags:

Catch-22,"This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction; critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos; and much more. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Soon to be a Hulu limited series starring Christopher Abbott, George Clooney, Kyle Chandler, and Hugh Laurie. Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.",['Joseph Heller'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U9V8JYt7WwoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=U9V8JYt7WwoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Catch-22&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-10-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U9V8JYt7WwoC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1607,4.357809583074051,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+Thousand+Leagues+Under+the+Sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,None,1289,4.124127230411172,"Here are the chosen tags:

Gilead,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award, Gilead is the long-hoped-for second novel by Marilynne Robinson, one of our finest writers--a hymn of praise and lamentation to the God-haunted existence that Reverend Ames loves passionately, and from which he will soon part. In 1956, toward the end of Reverend John Ames's life, he begins a letter to his young son, an account of himself and his forebears. Ames is the son of an Iowan preacher and the grandson of a minister who, as a young man in Maine, saw a vision of Christ bound in chains and came west to Kansas to fight for abolition: He ""preached men into the Civil War,"" then, at age fifty, became a chaplain in the Union Army, losing his right eye in battle. Reverend Ames writes to his son about the tension between his father--an ardent pacifist--and his grandfather, whose pistol and bloody shirts, concealed in an army blanket, may be relics from the fight between the abolitionists and those settlers who wanted to vote Kansas into the union as a slave state. And he tells a story of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, which are tested in his tender and strained relationship with his namesake, John Ames Boughton, his best friend's wayward son. This is also the tale of another remarkable vision--not a corporeal vision of God but the vision of life as a wondrously strange creation. It tells how wisdom was forged in Ames's soul during his solitary life, and how history lives through generations, pervasively present even when betrayed and forgotten.",['Marilynne Robinson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wAVPzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wAVPzQEACAAJ&dq=Gilead&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2020-08-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=wAVPzQEACAAJ&dq=Gilead&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],436,3.956422018348624,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Interview With The Vampire SIGNED First Edition,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Anne Rice, this sensuously written spellbinding classic remains 'the most successful vampire story since Bram Stoker's Dracula' (The Times) In a darkened room a young man sits telling the macabre and eerie story of his life - the story of a vampire, gifted with eternal life, cursed with an exquisite craving for human blood. Anne Rice's compulsively readable novel is arguably the most celebrated work of vampire fiction since Bram Stoker's Dracula was published in 1897. When Interview with the Vampire was originally published the Washington Post said it was: called Interview with the Vampire a 'thrilling, strikingly original work of the imagination . . . sometimes horrible, sometimes beautiful, always unforgettable'.

"Moby Dick;: Or, The whale,","Moby Dick is a novel by American writer Herman Melville. The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it ""the greatest book of the sea ever written."" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: ""Unforgettable phrases abound."" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, ""Call me Ishmael,"" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.",['Herman Melville'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moby+Dick%3B:+Or,+The+whale,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",BookRix,2022-02-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],452,4.128318584070796,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Moby Dick"":

Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics),"Published on 16 October 1847, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre was originally titled Jane Eyre: An Autobiography. The novel earned its author the distinction of being ‘the first historian of the private consciousness’. Jane Eyre, an orphan, living with her cruel aunt is punished for bullying her cousin and imprisoned in a ‘red room’. This is the same room where Jane’s uncle had died. Locked in, a young Jane is haunted by her uncle’s screams. Memories of an oppressive upbringing follow her like a shadow even at Lowood Charity School where she finds herself at the mercy of an abusive headmaster. As a governess at Thornfield Hall, Jane falls in love with her mysterious Byronic employer, Edward Rochester. Soon, she discovers a bitter truth about him and his ‘mad’ wife Bertha Mason. After a series of crests and troughs when Jane is ready to embark on yet another unpredictable journey, she is compelled to return to the man she had once abandoned.",['Charlote Brontë'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NVFnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NVFnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jane+Eyre:+Complete+and+Unabridged+(Puffin+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Om Books International,2018-07-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NVFnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1190,4.550420168067227,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged"":

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed,"In the Hugo-award winning, epic New York Times Bestseller and basis for the BBC miniseries, two men change England's history when they bring magic back into the world. In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England - until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear.

East Of Eden,"A masterpiece of Biblical scope, and the magnum opus of one of America’s most enduring authors, in a commemorative hardcover edition In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden ""the first book,"" and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. The masterpiece of Steinbeck’s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean, and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah’s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.",['John Steinbeck'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=East+Of+Eden&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2002-02-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],551,4.618874773139746,"Here are the chosen tags:

On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him, as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers.

1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"Hoe de wereld zich ontwikkelde na de ontdekking van Amerika De reizen van Columbus vormden het begin van een bijzondere uitwisseling van flora en fauna tussen Eurazië en Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Zo vonden onder meer tomaten, aardappelen, maïs, zilver en rubber hun weg naar Eurazië, en omgekeerd zijde, paarden, graan, koffie, appels - en slaven niet te vergeten - naar Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Een minder welkome uitwisseling was uiteraard die van insecten, bacteriën en virussen. Charles Mann laat zien dat deze zogeheten Columbian Exchange heeft gezorgd voor de opkomst van Europa, de ondergang van het Chinese keizerrijk en de verstoring van de ecologie in Afrika. Met 1493 heeft bestsellerauteur Charles Mann de belangrijkste biologische gebeurtenis sinds het uitsterven van de dinosauriërs onder de aandacht van een groot publiek weten te brengen. Charles Mann is correspondent voor The Atlantic en Science, en schrijft onder meer voor Fortune, The NewYork Times en The Washington Post. Zijn boek 1491.De ontdekking van precolumbiaans Amerika was een groot internationaal succes. Manns werk is vele malen bekroond. 'Het is Mann gelukt een gecompliceerd verhaal helder te vertellen (...).' - The New York Times '1493 is een meeslepend boek, dat de vele economische, agrarische en biologische kruisbestuivingen beschrijft die plaatsvonden nadat Columbus toevallig Amerika had ontdekt.' - TheWall Street Journal '(...) een bijzonder onderhoudend en evenwichtig boek.' - New Scientist '(...) boordevol interessante inzichten, wetenswaardigheden en onvoorziene, adembenemende ellende.' - NRCHandelsblad '(...) een uitermate rijk boek.' - Trouw '(...) een helder en onderhoudend verhaal over de mens en zijn medeorganismen (...).' - De Standaard '(...) wérkelijk een fascinerende, nieuwe wereld.' - De Pers",['Charles C.

"Monte Cristo,","The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",['Alexandre Dumas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Monte+Cristo,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,1846-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api,None,839,4.554231227651966,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Monte Cristo"":

Knife of Dreams (Wheel of Time),"The Wheel of Time is now an original series on Prime Video, starring Rosamund Pike as Moiraine! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him. In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown... In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within... The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph.

"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","New York Times Best Seller and Over 1 million copies sold! Over 750 5-Star reviews Wiese’s visit to the devil’s lair lasted just twenty-three minutes, but he returned with vivid details etched in his memory, capturing the attention of national media, including the Christian Broadcasting Network, Daystar Television Network, Trinity Broadcasting Network, the Miracle Channel, Sid Roth’s It’s Supernatural!, Sean Hannity’s America, Charisma News, and many others. Bill Wiese experienced something so horrifying it continues to captivate the world. He saw the searing flames of hell, felt total isolation, smelled the putrid and rotting stench, heard deafening screams of agony, and experienced terrorizing demons. Finally the strong hand of God lifted him out of the pit. Now Wiese shares his insights on commonly asked questions such as: Is hell a literal burning place? Where is hell? Do you have a body in hell? Are there degrees of punishment in hell? Are there children in hell? Can demons torment people in hell?

Skinny Dip,"Chaz Perrone might be the only marine scientist in the world who doesn’t know which way the Gulf Stream runs. He might also be the only one who went into biology just to make a killing, and now he’s found a way–doctoring water samples so that a ruthless agribusiness tycoon can continue illegally dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. When Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey, has figured out his scam, he pushes her overboard from a cruise liner into the night-dark Atlantic. Unfortunately for Chaz, his wife doesn’t die in the fall. Clinging blindly to a bale of Jamaican pot, Joey Perrone is plucked from the ocean by former cop and current loner Mick Stranahan. Instead of rushing to the police and reporting her husband’s crime, Joey decides to stay dead and (with Mick’s help) screw with Chaz until he screws himself. As Joey haunts and taunts her homicidal husband, as Chaz’s cold-blooded cohorts in pollution grow uneasy about his ineptitude and increasingly erratic behavior, as Mick Stranahan discovers that six failed marriages and years of island solitude haven’t killed the reckless romantic in him, we’re taken on a hilarious, full-throttle, pure Hiaasen ride through the warped politics and mayhem of the human environment, and the human heart.

One for the Money,"Now available in a special 25th anniversary edition! Discover where it all began—#1 New York Times bestselling author Janet Evanovich’s first “snappily written, fast-paced, and witty” (USA TODAY) novel in the beloved Stephanie Plum series featuring a feisty and funny heroine who “comes roaring in like a blast of very fresh air” (The Washington Post). Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She’s a product of the “burg,” a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There’s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase should be interesting…and could also be extremely dangerous.",['Janet Evanovich'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z66WDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z66WDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=One+for+the+Money&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Scribner,2019-06-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=z66WDwAAQBAJ&dq=One+for+the+Money&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],856,4.393691588785047,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""One for the Money"":

Moby Dick,"Moby Dick is a novel by American author Herman Melville. It was first published in 1851. It is considered one of the treasures of world literature. The story of the novel tells the adventures of the wandering sailor Ishmael and his voyage on the whaleship Pequod. Pequod is commanded by Captain Ahab.

"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet A. Jacobs: A True Tale of Slavery, by John S. Jacobs","'The degradations, the wrongs, the vices, that grow out of slavery, are more than I can describe.' Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in the American South and went on to write one of the most extraordinary slave narratives. First published pseudonymously in 1861, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl describes Jacobs's treatment at the hands of her owners, her eventual escape to the North, and her perilous existence evading recapture as a fugitive slave. To save herself from sexual assault and protect her children she is forced to hide for seven years in a tiny attic space, suffering terrible psychological and physical pain. Written to expose the appalling treatment of slaves in the South and the racism of the free North, and to advance the abolitionist cause, Incidents is notable for its careful construction and literary effects. Jacobs's story of self-emancipation and a growing feminist consciousness is the tale of an individual and a searing indictment of slavery's inhumanity. This edition includes the short memoir by Jacobs's brother, John S. Jacobs, 'A True Tale of Slavery'. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,"In Jared Diamond’s follow-up to the Pulitzer-Prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, the author explores how climate change, the population explosion and political discord create the conditions for the collapse of civilization. Diamond is also the author of Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis Environmental damage, climate change, globalization, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of societies around the world, but some found solutions and persisted. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe, and weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Collapse moves from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society’s apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana. Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?",['Jared Diamond'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mYPXUHZCp3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mYPXUHZCp3gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Collapse:+How+Societies+Choose+to+Fail+or+Succeed&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2011-01-04,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mYPXUHZCp3gC&dq=Collapse:+How+Societies+Choose+to+Fail+or+Succeed&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],558,3.9695340501792113,"Here are the chosen tags:

On Beauty,"Aquinas on Beauty explores the nature and role of beauty in the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Beginning with a standard definition of beauty provided by Aquinas, it explores each of the components of that definition. The result is a comprehensive account of Aquinas’s formal view on the subject, supplemented by an exploration into Aquinas’s commentary on Dionysius’s Divine Names, including a comparison of his views with those of both Dionysius and those of Aquinas’s mentor, Albert the Great. The book also highlights the tight connection in Aquinas’s thought between aesthetics and ethics, and illustrates how Aquinas preserves what is best about aesthetic traditions preceding him, and anticipates what is best about aesthetic traditions that would follow, marrying objective and subjective aesthetic intuitions and charting a kind of via media between the common extremes.",['Christopher Scott Sevier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=On+Beauty&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lexington Books,2015-02-12,http://books.google.nl/books?id=isKlBwAAQBAJ&dq=On+Beauty&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],478,3.3598326359832638,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War,"The Red Badge of Courage is a war novel by American author Stephen Crane (1871-1900). Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a ""red badge of courage,"" to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as standard-bearer.Although Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1893, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by Century Magazine) as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1982.",['Stephen Crane'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IbH_rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IbH_rQEACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Badge+of+Courage:+An+Episode+of+the+American+Civil+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2015-02-14,http://books.google.com/books?id=IbH_rQEACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Badge+of+Courage:+An+Episode+of+the+American+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,None,572,3.8181818181818183,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War"" by Stephen Crane:

The Pilot's Wife,"Anita Shreve's hauntingly beautiful #1 bestseller and Oprah's Book Club selection about tragedy, grief, betrayal, and the 'impossibility of knowing another person.' As a pilot's wife, Kathryn has learned to expect both intense exhilaration and long periods alone, but nothing has prepared her for a late-night knock that lets her know her husband has died in a crash. Until now, Kathryn Lyons's life has been peaceful if unextraordinary: a satisfying job teaching high school in the New England mill town of her childhood; a picture-perfect home by the ocean; a precocious, independent-minded fifteen-year-old daughter; and a happy marriage whose occasional dull passages she attributes to the unavoidable deadening of time. As Kathryn struggles with her grief, she descends into a maelstrom of publicity stirred up by the modern hunger for the details of tragedy. Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret life?",['Anita Shreve'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IG-q9FKkWGwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IG-q9FKkWGwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Pilot%27s+Wife&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Back Bay Books,2007-07-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IG-q9FKkWGwC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],472,3.440677966101695,"Here are the chosen tags:

"Moby Dick or The White Whale (World's Greatest Literature, 17)","Moby Dick is a novel by American writer Herman Melville. The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it ""the greatest book of the sea ever written."" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: ""Unforgettable phrases abound."" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, ""Call me Ishmael,"" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.",['Herman Melville'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moby+Dick+or+The+White+Whale+(World%27s+Greatest+Literature,+17)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",BookRix,2022-02-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],456,4.131578947368421,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Moby Dick or The White Whale"" by Herman Melville:

Enchantment,"In Enchantment, Orson Scott Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure. The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm. Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest—or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy’s fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it. This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago. A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.",['Orson Scott Card'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DeRKDZKQSk0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DeRKDZKQSk0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Enchantment&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Del Rey,2005-05-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DeRKDZKQSk0C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],356,4.213483146067416,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Enchantment"" by Orson Scott Card:

Who Moved My Cheese? An-Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life,"THE #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER WITH OVER 28 MILLION COPIES IN PRINT! A timeless business classic, Who Moved My Cheese? uses a simple parable to reveal profound truths about dealing with change so that you can enjoy less stress and more success in your work and in your life. It would be all so easy if you had a map to the Maze. If the same old routines worked. If they'd just stop moving ""The Cheese."" But things keep changing... Most people are fearful of change, both personal and professional, because they don't have any control over how or when it happens to them. Since change happens either to the individual or by the individual, Dr. Spencer Johnson, the coauthor of the multimillion bestseller The One Minute Manager, uses a deceptively simple story to show that when it comes to living in a rapidly changing world, what matters most is your attitude. Exploring a simple way to take the fear and anxiety out of managing the future, Who Moved My Cheese? can help you discover how to anticipate, acknowledge, and accept change in order to have a positive impact on your job, your relationships, and every aspect of your life.",['Spencer Johnson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXQDqU1zfe0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HXQDqU1zfe0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Who+Moved+My+Cheese%3F+An-Amazing+Way+to+Deal+with+Change+in+Your+Work+and+in+Your+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1998-09-08,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HXQDqU1zfe0C&dq=Who+Moved+My+Cheese%3F+An-Amazing+Way+to+Deal+with+Change+in+Your+Work+and+in+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],1498,3.4072096128170895,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Who Moved My Cheese?"":

Slaughter-House Five,"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Slaughter-House+Five&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999-01-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Slaughter-House+Five&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],837,4.32258064516129,"Here are the chosen tags:

Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition),"'My dear, I don't give a damn.' Margaret Mitchell’s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years. Beloved and thought by many to be the greatest of the American novels, Gone with the Wind is a story of love, hope and loss set against the tense historical background of the American Civil War. The lovers at the novel’s centre – the selfish, privileged Scarlett O’Hara and rakish Rhett Butler – are magnetic: pulling readers into the tangled narrative of a struggle to survive that cannot be forgotten.

Moby Dick Or the Whale,"Moby-Dick is one of the great epics in all of literature. Captain Ahab's hunt for the white whale drives the narrative at a relentless pace, while Ishmael's meditations on whales and whaling, on the sublime indifference of nature, and on the grimy physical details of the extraction of oil provide a reflective counterpoint to the headlong idolatrous quest. Sometimes read as a terrifying study of monomania or as a critical inquiry into the effects of reducing life to symbols, Moby-Dick also offers colorful and often comic glimpses of life aboard a whaling ship. For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life an essay on the text, and notes.",['Herman Melville'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moby+Dick+Or+the+Whale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2002-12-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QxZuDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],453,4.1302428256070645,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Moby Dick; or, The Whale"":

On their first expeditions--led by incompetent officers and accompanied by the robust, dauntless whore known as the Great Western--they will face death at the hands of the cunning Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and the silent Apache Gomez. They will be astonished by the Mexican army. And Gus will meet the love of his life. Comanche Moon Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow Call, now in their middle years, are still figuring out how to deal with the ever-increasing tensions of adult life--Gus with his great love, Clara Forsythe, and Call with Maggie Tilton, the young whore who loves him--when they sign up to pursue the Comanche horse thief Kicking Wolf into Mexico. On this mission their captain, Inish Scull, is captured by the brutally cruel Mexican bandit Ahumado, and Gus and Call must come to the rescue, with the aid of new friends including Joshua Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker, as well as the renowned Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. Lonesome Dove Gus and Call, now retired from the Texas Rangers and settled in the border town of Lonesome Dove running the Hat Creek Cattle Company, are visited by their old friend Jake Spoon, who convinces Gus and Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them north to Montana in order to start a cattle ranch in untouched territory. Gus is further motivated by a desire to see the love of his life, Clara Allen (nee Forsythe), who now lives with her children and comatose horse-trader husband in Ogallala, Nebraska. On the way to Montana they travel through wild country full of thieves, murderers, and a lifetime's worth of unforgettable adventure. Streets of Laredo Woodrow Call is back in Texas, a Ranger once again and a general gun-for-hire, but increasingly a relic as the westward sprawl of the railroads rapidly settles the once lawless frontier. Hired by a railroad tycoon to hunt down a dangerous bandit named Joey Garza, Call sets out once again with a hapless Yankee named Ned Brookshire who works for the railroad company that hired Call. Call's old friend Pea Eye Parker--who initially refused to join the expedition because of his family--sets off with the Kickapoo tracker Famous Shoes to try to catch up with Call, until he runs into troubles of his own. The long pursuit of Garza leads them all across the last wild stretches of the West into a hellhole known as Crow Town and, finally, into the vast, relentless plains of the Texas frontier.",['Larry McMurtry'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rZohf4RlkCQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rZohf4RlkCQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lonesome+Dove&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rZohf4RlkCQC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],918,4.749455337690632,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Lonesome Dove"":

Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices,"Have you ever wondered why we Christians do what we do for church every Sunday morning? Why do we “dress up” for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, and choirs? This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church—to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role—you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.",['Frank Viola' ' George Barna'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Pagan+Christianity:+The+Origins+of+Our+Modern+Church+Practices&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",2010-09-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cPTBmcHa-i0C&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],509,4.176817288801572,"Here are the chosen tags:

Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold! (Landover Series),"Here in his first non-Shannara novel, Terry Brooks has written a gripping story of mystery, magic, and adventure—sure to delight fantasy readers everywhere. Landover was a genuine magic kingdom, with fairy folk and wizardry, just as the advertisement has promised. But after he purchased it, Ben Holiday learned that there were a few details the ad had failed to mention. The kingdom was in ruin. The Barons refused to recognize a king, and the peasants were without hope. A dragon was laying waste the countryside, while an evil witch plotted to destroy everything. Ben's only followers were the incompetent Court Magician; Abernathy, the talking dog who served as Court Scribe; and the lovely Willow—but she had a habit of putting down roots in the moonlight and turning into a tree. The Paladin, legendary champion of the Kings of Landover, seemed to be only a myth and an empty suit of armor. To put the final touch on the whole affair, Ben soon learned that the Iron Mark, terrible lord of the demons, had challenged all prospective Kings of Landover to duel to the death—a duel which no human could hope to win. The task of proving his right to be King seemed hopeless. But Ben Holiday was stubborn. . . .",['Terry Brooks'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UD9bqLruYaUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UD9bqLruYaUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Magic+Kingdom+for+Sale+-+Sold!+(Landover+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Del Rey,2008-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UD9bqLruYaUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],270,4.177777777777778,"Here are the chosen tags:

George Orwell 1984,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking.

Cold Mountain A Novel,"In 1997, Charles Frazier’s debut novel Cold Mountain made publishing history when it sailed to the top of The New York Times best-seller list for sixty-one weeks, won numerous literary awards, including the National Book Award, and went on to sell over three million copies. Now, the beloved American epic returns, reissued by Grove Press to coincide with the publication of Frazier’s eagerly-anticipated second novel, Thirteen Moons. Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, a Confederate soldier named Inman decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains to Ada, the woman he loves. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father’s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.",['Charles Frazier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L9ve3Zz__1cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=L9ve3Zz__1cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cold+Mountain+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Grove/Atlantic, Inc.",2007-12-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L9ve3Zz__1cC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],783,3.8301404853128993,"Here are the chosen tags:

My Family and Other Animals,"The inspiration for The Durrells in Corfu, a Masterpiece production on public television: A naturalist’s account of his childhood on the exotic Greek island. When the Durrells could no longer endure the gray English climate, they did what any sensible family would do: sold their house and relocated to the sun-soaked island of Corfu. As they settled into their new home, hilarious mishaps ensued as a ten-year-old Gerald Durrell pursued his interest in natural history and explored the island’s fauna. Soon, toads and tortoises, bats and butterflies—as well as scorpions, geckos, ladybugs, praying mantises, octopuses, pigeons, and gulls—became a common sight in the Durrell villa. Uproarious tales of the island’s animals and Durrell’s fond reflections on his family bring this delightful memoir to life. Capturing the joyous chaos of growing up in an unconventional household, My Family and Other Animals will transport you to a place you won’t want to leave.

Assassin's Apprentice,"A gorgeously illustrated anniversary edition of the book that launched the epic Farseer Trilogy, praised by George R. R. Martin as “fantasy as it ought to be written” and Lin-Manuel Miranda as “an incredible series,” featuring a new foreword by Robin Hobb and ten illustrations. Twenty-five years ago, Robin Hobb’s first novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning. Thus began a beloved saga spanning multiple series, full of adventure, magic, and sinister plots. To celebrate a quarter-century of wonder, this special edition of Assassin’s Apprentice presents a modern classic as it’s never been seen before: in hardcover, with ten beautiful illustrations by Magali Villeneuve. Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father’s gruff stableman. He is treated as an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz’s blood runs the magic Skill—and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom. Praise for Robin Hobb and Assassin’s Apprentice “Fantasy as it ought to be written . . . Robin Hobb’s books are diamonds in a sea of zircons.”—George R. R. Martin “A gleaming debut in the crowded field of epic fantasies . . . a delightful take on the powers and politics behind the throne.”—Publishers Weekly “This is the kind of book you fall into, and start reading slower as you get to the end, because you don’t want it to be over.”—Steven Brust",['Robin Hobb'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qdqsVz0Ky0IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qdqsVz0Ky0IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Assassin%27s+Apprentice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Spectra,2002-11-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qdqsVz0Ky0IC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],531,4.216572504708098,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.",['Arthur Golden'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Geisha+(Signed)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,1999-11-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1658,4.4487334137515075,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Stranger In A Strange Land: Library Edition,"In 'Vreemdelingen in hun eigen land' verlaat de beroemde socioloog Arlie Hochschild Californië, haar progressief linkse, kosmopolitische enclave vol gelijkgestemden, en trekt vijf jaar op met haar rechtse landgenoten in Louisiana, een van de armste en meest conservatieve staten van Amerika. Daar leert ze mensen kennen die een heel ander leven leiden en er ideeën op nahouden die haaks staan op die van haar. Hochschild raakt bevriend met een automonteur, een aannemer, een telefoonreparateur, een handelsreiziger, een vrachtwagenchauffeur, een conciërge en een gospelzanger, en probeert te achterhalen waarom zij tegen hun eigen belangen in aanhangers zijn van politici als Donald Trump en op hem stemmen. Het blijkt dat de angst voor culturele achterstelling, economische achteruitgang en het gevoel verraden te zijn door de staat doorslaggevend zijn. Tijdens haar zoektocht vindt Hochschild antwoorden op een van de cruciale vragen van de hedendaagse westerse politiek: waarom verzetten mensen zich met hand en tand tegen 'progressieve' overheidsinterventies terwijl zij daar zelf het meest van kunnen profiteren? Een must read voor iedereen die de opkomst van het rechtspopulisme en de alt-right-beweging wil doorgronden.",['Arlie Russell Hochschild'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zd8yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zd8yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Stranger+In+A+Strange+Land:+Library+Edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Amsterdam University Press,2017-08-29,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zd8yDwAAQBAJ&dq=Stranger+In+A+Strange+Land:+Library+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],544,3.8768382352941178,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Stranger In A Strange Land: Library Edition"":

Today Book Club Pick June 2003 Selection,"Adored by its fans, deplored by its critics, Oprah's Book Club has been at the center of arguments about cultural authority and literary taste since it began in 1996. Reading with Oprah explores the club's revolutionary fusion of books, television, and commerce and tells the engaging and in-depth story of the OBC phenomenon. Kathleen Rooney combines extensive research with a dynamic voice to reveal the club's far-reaching cultural impact and its role as crucible for the clash between ""high"" and ""low"" literary taste. Comprehensive and up-to-date, the book covers the club from its inception in 1996, through the Jonathan Franzen contretemps, the surprising suspension in 2002, and, after the club's return in 2003, the progression from ""great books"" to memoir. New material includes an extensive look at the James Frey scandal and Oprah's turn to contemporary fiction, including The Road and Middlesex. Through close examination of Winfrey's picks and personal interviews with book club authors and readers, Rooney demonstrates how the club that Barbara Kingsolver calls ""one of the best possible uses of a television set"" has, according to Wally Lamb, ""gotten people of all ages to read, to read more, and to read widely.""",['Kathleen Rooney'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GWDbIQpUvRUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GWDbIQpUvRUC&pg=PA264&dq=Today+Book+Club+Pick+June+2003+Selection&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Arkansas Press,2008-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GWDbIQpUvRUC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],350,3.782857142857143,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, this extraordinary work of investigative journalism takes readers inside America’s isolated Mormon Fundamentalist communities. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",['Jon Krakauer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Under+the+Banner+of+Heaven:+A+Story+of+Violent+Faith&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2004-06-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],829,4.108564535585042,"Here are the tags that fit best:

"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy","Little Women with a twist: four sisters from a blended family experience the challenges and triumphs of life in NYC in this beautiful full-color graphic novel perfect for fans of Roller Girl and Smile. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are having a really tough year: with their father serving in the military overseas, they must work overtime to make ends meet...and each girl is struggling in her own way. Whether it's school woes, health issues, boy troubles, or simply feeling lost, the March sisters all need the same thing: support from each other. Only by coming together--and sharing lots of laughs and tears--will these four young women find the courage to discover who they truly are as individuals...and as a family. Meg is the eldest March, and she has a taste for the finer things in life. She dreams of marrying rich, enjoying fabulous clothes and parties, and leaving her five-floor walk-up apartment behind. Jo pushes her siblings to be true to themselves, yet feels like no one will accept her for who she truly is. Her passion for writing gives her an outlet to feel worthy in the eyes of her friends and family. Beth is the shy sister with a voice begging to be heard. But with a guitar in hand, she finds a courage that inspires her siblings to seize the day and not take life for granted. Amy may be the baby of the family, but she has the biggest personality. Though she loves to fight with her sisters, her tough exterior protects a vulnerable heart that worries about her family's future.",['Rey Terciero'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U9BQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=U9BQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Little+women,+or,+Meg,+Jo,+Beth+and+Amy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Little, Brown Books for Young Readers",2019-02-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U9BQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Juvenile Fiction'],647,4.418856259659969,"Here are the chosen tags:

the Picture of Dorian Gray,"The Picture of Dorian Gray was first published as a serial in Lippencott’s Monthly Magazine, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without Wilde’s approval. Wilde soon expanded it and republished it as a novel, including a short preface justifying his art. Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, Dorian Gray today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives. Couched in Wilde’s trademark cutting wit, Dorian Gray is still being adapted today, with Dorian and his moldering portrait remaining cultural touchstones.

In 1820, the whaleship Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale, leaving the desperate crew to drift for more than ninety days in three tiny boats. Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents and vivid details about the Nantucket whaling tradition to reveal the chilling facts of this infamous maritime disaster.

Pride & Prejudice (Penguin Classics),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

Under the Banner of Heaven,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, this extraordinary work of investigative journalism takes readers inside America’s isolated Mormon Fundamentalist communities. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",['Jon Krakauer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Under+the+Banner+of+Heaven&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2004-06-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0DQaTU7Opq0C&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],837,4.112305854241338,"Here are the tags that fit best:

I know this much is true,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",['Wally Lamb'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=I+know+this+much+is+true&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper,1998-06-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],902,4.548780487804878,"Here are the chosen tags:

"The time machine,: An invention,","The Time Machine is one of the most enduring works of the English language. A hundred years after it was first published, the book continues to be studied. The 1895 London first edition is used as a basis for the exhaustive annotations and other critical apparatus of the world's foremost Wellsian scholar. The widely reprinted version of 1924 is also fully accounted for. For most students, one of the chief points of interest is what the novel signified to readers when it was first published and how it relates to Wells's later works. Accordingly, the annotations focus on these questions.

Travels With Charley,"An intimate journey across and in search of America, as told by one of its most beloved writers, in a deluxe centennial edition In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

How to Read a Book,"De invloed van Mesopotamië kan niet worden overschat. Grandeur en handelsgeest brachten het land tot duurzame welvaart waar iedereen door hard werken tot zijn recht kon komen. George Clason beschrijft de werkwijze die het oude Perzië zo’n langdurige periode van vrede en grote rijkdom heeft geschonken. Als een soort wet van de zwaartekracht gebruikten de Babyloniërs economische regels die waren gebaseerd op eerlijkheid, handigheid, werklust en afspraak is afspraak. In tien levendige verhalen wordt je ontspannen meegesleept in de dynamiek van het succesvolle Babylonië en spelenderwijs leer je de zeven gouden regels voor welvaart en welzijn. Dit boek kent ontelbaar veel lezers en iedereen is er beter van geworden.

Welcome back to Blackwood Farm. Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, who’s come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks Lestat’s help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken Mona’s child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the book’s centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion with Memnoch the Devil. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves Patsy’s ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.

The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library),"A must-have new edition of one of the great American novels--and one of America's most popular--featuring a new introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko, and a striking new cover that brings the quintessential novel of the Roaring Twenties into the 2020s A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.",['F.

Everything Is Illuminated : A Novel,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. Jonathan Safran Foer's debut—""a funny, moving...deeply felt novel about the dangers of confronting the past and the redemption that comes with laughing at it, even when that seems all but impossible."" (Time) With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man—also named Jonathan Safran Foer—sets out to find the woman who might or might not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past. As their adventure unfolds, Jonathan imagines the history of his grandfather’s village, conjuring a magical fable of startling symmetries that unite generations across time. As his search moves back in time, the fantastical history moves forward, until reality collides with fiction in a heart-stopping scene of extraordinary power. “Imagine a novel as verbally cunning as A Clockwork Orange, as harrowing as The Painted Bird, as exuberant and twee as Candide, and you have Everything Is Illuminated . . . Read it, and you'll feel altered, chastened—seared in the fire of something new.” — Washington Post “A rambunctious tour de force of inventive and intelligent storytelling . . . Foer can place his reader’s hand on the heart of human experience, the transcendent beauty of human connections.

The forgotten soldier,"An international bestseller, this is a German soldier's first-hand account of life on Russian front during the second half of the Second World War. When Guy Sajer joins the infantry full of ideals in the summer of 1942, the German army is enjoying unparalleled success in Russia. However, he quickly finds that for the foot soldier the glory of military success hides a much harsher reality of hunger, fatigue and constant deprivation. Posted to the crack Grosse Deutschland division, with its sadistic instructors who shoot down those who fail to make the grade, he enters a violent and remorseless world where all youthful hope is gradually ground down, and all that matters is the brute will to survive. As the biting cold of the Russian winter sets in, and the tide begins to turn against the Germans, life becomes an endless round of pounding artillery attacks and vicious combat against a relentless and merciless Red Army. A book of stunning force, this is an unforgettable reminder of the horrors of war.",['Guy Sajer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1a0Kmvkn8XcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1a0Kmvkn8XcC&dq=The+forgotten+soldier&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2013-04-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=1a0Kmvkn8XcC&dq=The+forgotten+soldier&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],347,4.694524495677234,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Federalist Papers,"The Federalist Papers (1787-1788) is a collection of essays and articles by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. Written in support of the recently completed Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers were intended to support the ratification process of the new United States Constitution. When the Constitutional Convention was completed on September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, the newly-agreed upon Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. As opponents of a strong centralized government began attacking the Constitution in the press, Hamilton recruited Jay and Madison to contribute articles and essays in favor of Federalism to prominent journals and newspapers. Published between October 27, 1787 and May 28, 1788, The Federalist Papers were written by the three authors under the pseudonym “Publius.” Although Hamilton wrote the vast majority, Madison’s and Jay’s contributions are still seen as essential works on the philosophy of American governance. Federalist Nos. 10 and 14, both written by Madison, are regarded as especially significant for arguing for the possibility of effectively governing an expansive republic. In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton argues against adding a Bill of Rights, a proposed compromise with Anti-Federalists that would eventually make up the first ten Amendments to the Constitution. Other important topics introduced or explained in The Federalist Papers include the doctrine of judicial review, the case for a single chief executive, and the purpose of checks and balances. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of The Federalist Papers is a classic of American political history reimagined for modern readers.",['Alexander Hamilton' ' John Jay' ' James Madison'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8OEsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8OEsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Federalist+Papers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Graphic Arts Books,2021-02-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8OEsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],614,4.169381107491857,"Here are the chosen tags:

"The Truth about Hillary (Clinton): What She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far She'll Go to Become President","Hillary Rodham Clinton is the most polarizing figure in American politics. Love her or hate her, everyone has a strong opinion about the former first lady turned senator who is almost certainly going to run for president in 2008. Despite more than a dozen years in the national spotlight and more than a dozen unauthorized books about her, she has managed to keep many secrets from the public especially about her turbulent marriage and its impact on her career. There have been plenty of rumors about what Hillary and Bill Clinton did behind closed doors, but never a definitive book that exposes the truth. Bestselling author Edward Klein draws on rare access to inside sources to reveal what Hillary knew and when she knew it during her years as first lady, especially during her husband’s impeachment. Klein’s book, embargoed until publication, will break news about the choices and calculations she has made over the years. It will also prove that she lied to America in her bestselling autobiography Living History. When she was just a little girl, Hillary Rodham dreamed of becoming the first female president, and her lifelong dream is almost within reach. But just as the swift boat veterans convinced millions of voters that John Kerry lacked the character to be president, Klein’s book will influence everyone who is sizing up the character of Hillary Clinton.",['Edward Klein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Truth+about+Hillary+(Clinton):+What+She+Knew,+When+She+Knew+It,+and+How+Far+She%27ll+Go+to+Become+President&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,2005-06-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wTluOHsLZZAC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],458,2.967248908296943,"Here are the chosen tags:

Interpreter of Maladies (Highbridge Distribution),"FINALIST FOR THE 2017 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR FICTION Named a Best Book of 2017 by NPR, Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed, Bustle, and Electric Literature “There was a time I would have called Lisa Ko’s novel beautifully written, ambitious, and moving, and all of that is true, but it’s more than that now: if you want to understand a forgotten and essential part of the world we live in, The Leavers is required reading.” —Ann Patchett, author of Commonwealth Lisa Ko’s powerful debut, The Leavers, is the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for Fiction, awarded by Barbara Kingsolver for a novel that addresses issues of social justice. One morning, Deming Guo’s mother, Polly, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, goes to her job at a nail salon—and never comes home. No one can find any trace of her. With his mother gone, eleven-year-old Deming is left mystified and bereft. Eventually adopted by a pair of well-meaning white professors, Deming is moved from the Bronx to a small town upstate and renamed Daniel Wilkinson. But far from all he’s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his adoptive parents’ desire that he assimilate with his memories of his mother and the community he left behind. Told from the perspective of both Daniel—as he grows into a directionless young man—and Polly, Ko’s novel gives us one of fiction’s most singular mothers. Loving and selfish, determined and frightened, Polly is forced to make one heartwrenching choice after another. Set in New York and China, The Leavers is a vivid examination of borders and belonging. It’s a moving story of how a boy comes into his own when everything he loves is taken away, and how a mother learns to live with the mistakes of the past.",['Lisa Ko'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nG5YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nG5YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Interpreter+of+Maladies+(Highbridge+Distribution)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Algonquin Books,2018-04-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=nG5YDwAAQBAJ&dq=Interpreter+of+Maladies+(Highbridge+Distribution)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],448,4.363839285714286,"Here are the chosen tags:

Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst The Rwandan Holocaust,"Immaculee Ilibagiza grew up in a country she loved, surrounded by a family she cherished. But in 1994 her idyllic world was ripped apart as Rwanda descended into a bloody genocide. Immaculee’s family was brutally murdered during a killing spree that lasted three months and claimed the lives of nearly a million Rwandans. Incredibly, Immaculee survived the slaughter. For 91 days, she and seven other women huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor while hundreds of machete-wielding killers hunted for them. It was during those endless hours of unspeakable terror that Immaculee discovered the power of prayer, eventually shedding her fear of death and forging a profound and lasting relationship with God. She emerged from her bathroom hideout having discovered the meaning of truly unconditional love—a love so strong she was able seek out and forgive her family’s killers. The triumphant story of this remarkable young woman’s journey through the darkness of genocide will inspire anyone whose life has been touched by fear, suffering, and loss.",['Immaculee Ilibagiza'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z1_6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z1_6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Left+to+Tell:+Discovering+God+Amidst+The+Rwandan+Holocaust&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Hay House, Inc",2014-04-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z1_6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Left+to+Tell:+Discovering+God+Amidst+The+Rwandan+Holocaust&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],667,4.833583208395802,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book:

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry into Values,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narrator's relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism.

Emma,"The culmination of Jane Austen's genius, a sparkling comedy of love and marriage--now in a stunning 200th-anniversary Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Now a major motion picture starring Anya Taylor-Joy Beautiful, clever, rich--and single--Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others.

The Guns of August,"PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • “A brilliant piece of military history which proves up to the hilt the force of Winston Churchill’s statement that the first month of World War I was ‘a drama never surpassed.’”—Newsweek Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time In this landmark account, renowned historian Barbara W. Tuchman re-creates the first month of World War I: thirty days in the summer of 1914 that determined the course of the conflict, the century, and ultimately our present world. Beginning with the funeral of Edward VII, Tuchman traces each step that led to the inevitable clash. And inevitable it was, with all sides plotting their war for a generation. Dizzyingly comprehensive and spectacularly portrayed with her famous talent for evoking the characters of the war’s key players, Tuchman’s magnum opus is a classic for the ages. The Proud Tower, the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Guns of August, and The Zimmermann Telegram comprise Barbara W. Tuchman’s classic histories of the First World War era",['Barbara W.

A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander),"Eagerly anticipated by her legions of fans, this sixth novel in Diana Gabaldon’s bestselling Outlander saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction from one of the most popular authors of our time. Since the initial publication of Outlander fifteen years ago, Diana Gabaldon’s New York Times bestselling saga has won the hearts of readers the world over — and sold more than twelve million books. Now, A Breath of Snow and Ashes continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire. The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest. With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence — with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.",['Diana Gabaldon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N0Oh9YuuI9oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N0Oh9YuuI9oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Breath+of+Snow+and+Ashes+(Outlander)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor Canada,2010-12-17,http://books.google.com/books?id=N0Oh9YuuI9oC&dq=A+Breath+of+Snow+and+Ashes+(Outlander)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],525,4.424761904761905,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes"" by Diana Gabaldon:

We Were the Mulvaneys,"An Oprah Book Club® selection A New York Times Notable Book The Mulvaneys are blessed by all that makes life sweet. But something happens on Valentine’s Day, 1976—an incident that is hushed up in the town and never spoken of in the Mulvaney home—that rends the fabric of their family life...with tragic consequences. Years later, the youngest son attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys’ former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that brought about the family’s tragic downfall. Profoundly cathartic, this extraordinary novel unfolds as if Oates, in plumbing the darkness of the human spirit, has come upon a source of light at its core. Moving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering. “It’s the novel closest to my heart....I’m deeply moved that Oprah Winfrey has selected this novel for Oprah’s Book Club, a family novel presented to Oprah’s vast American family.”—Joyce Carol Oates",['Joyce Carol Oates'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6dLMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6dLMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=We+Were+the+Mulvaneys&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2001-01-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=6dLMDwAAQBAJ&dq=We+Were+the+Mulvaneys&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],379,3.2638522427440635,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""We Were the Mulvaneys"":

Brave new world; (Harper's modern classics),"The astonishing novel Brave New World, originally published in 1932, presents Aldous Huxley's legendary vision of a world of tomorrow utterly transformed. In Huxley's darkly satiric yet chillingly prescient imagining of a ""utopian"" future, humans are genetically designed and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively serve a ruling order. A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, it remains remarkably relevant to this day as both a warning to be heeded and as a thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment. This deluxe edition also includes the nonfiction work ""Brave New World Revisited,"" ""a thought-jabbing, terrifying book"" (Chicago Tribune), first published in 1958. It is a fascinating essay in which Huxley compares the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy envisioned in Brave New World. He scrutinizes threats to humanity such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them.

Watership Down,"Watership Down by Richard Adams is a true classic. This stirring tale of courage and survival against the odds has become one of the best-loved animal adventures of all time. 'We've got to go away before it's too late.' Fiver was only a small rabbit, but he had a sixth sense and foresaw that disaster was about to destroy the warren. Few believed him. Led by his brother Hazel, a small band of rabbits set out on a perilous journey to find a safe home. Fiver's intuition finally leads them to Watership Down. But here they encounter the greatest threat of all. ***Winner of the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize*** 'A gripping story of rebellion in a rabbit warren and the subsequent adventures of the rebels.

The best story about wild animals since The Wind in the Willows. Very funny, exciting, often moving' Evening Standard 'A great book. A whole world is created, perfectly real in itself, yet constituting a deep incidental comment on human affairs' Guardian Richard Adams grew up in Berkshire, the son of a country doctor. After an education at Oxford, he spent six years in the army and then went into the Civil Service. He originally began telling the story of Watership Down to his two daughters and they insisted he publish it as a book.

The Four Loves,"A repackaged edition of the revered author's classic work that examines the four types of human love: affection, friendship, erotic love, and the love of God—part of the C. S. Lewis Signature Classics series. C.S. Lewis—the great British writer, scholar, lay theologian, broadcaster, Christian apologist, and bestselling author of Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, The Chronicles of Narnia, and many other beloved classics—contemplates the essence of love and how it works in our daily lives in one of his most famous works of nonfiction. Lewis examines four varieties of human love: affection, the most basic form; friendship, the rarest and perhaps most insightful; Eros, passionate love; charity, the greatest and least selfish. Throughout this compassionate and reasoned study, he encourages readers to open themselves to all forms of love—the key to understanding that brings us closer to God.",['C. S.

A Fine Balance,"With a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall the work of Charles Dickens, this magnificent novel captures all the cruelty and corruption, dignity and heroism, of India. The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, A Fine Balance creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.",['Rohinton Mistry'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WcaFd95RABEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WcaFd95RABEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Fine+Balance&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2010-07-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WcaFd95RABEC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1628,4.410933660933661,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""A Fine Balance"" by Rohinton Mistry:

Kushiel's Dart,"Fifty Shades of Grey meets Game of Thrones, Kushiel's Dart is the first in a triptych of beautifully constructed historical fantasies that combine passion, danger, great battles, and deep eroticism. The land of Terre d’Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel’s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies.

Zen And The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narrator's relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism. Resonant with the confusions of existence, this classic is a touching and transcendent book of life.

Of Mice And Men,"A controversial tale of friendship and tragedy during the Great Depression A Penguin Classic Over seventy-five years since its first publication, Steinbeck’s tale of commitment, loneliness, hope, and loss remains one of America’s most widely read and taught novels. An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as “a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today’s leading Steinbeck scholars. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['John Steinbeck'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Of+Mice+And+Men&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1994-02-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=nE_Si_bv-W4C&dq=Of+Mice+And+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],934,4.380085653104925,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics),"This carefully crafted ebook: ""The Bell Jar"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Esther Greenwood, a young woman from the suburbs of Boston, gains a summer internship at a prominent magazine in New York City, under editor Jay Cee; however, Esther is neither stimulated nor excited by either the big city or the glamorous culture and lifestyle that girls her age are expected to idolize and emulate. She instead finds her experience to be frightening and disorienting. From hereafter her mental state keeps deteriorating until she starts feeling helpless as if being kept inside a glass bell jar! The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas"" in 1963, the novel is semi-autobiographical, with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a roman à clef because the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother.",['Sylvia Plath'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bell+Jar+:+A+Novel+(Perennial+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,e-artnow,2018-07-29,http://books.google.com/books?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bell+Jar+:+A+Novel+(Perennial+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],498,4.427710843373494,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""The Bell Jar"" by Sylvia Plath:

Slaughterhouse-Five,"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Slaughterhouse-Five&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999-01-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=pWyLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Slaughterhouse-Five&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2489,4.325431900361591,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Slaughterhouse-Five"":

Redeeming Love,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE starring Abigail Cowen, Tom Lewis, Nina Dobrev, with Logan Marshall Green and Eric Dane, special appearance by Famke Janssen. Distributed by Universal Pictures with a screenplay by Francine Rivers and D.J. Caruso. California’s gold country, 1850. A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep. Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside. Then she meets Michael Hosea, a man who seeks his Father’s heart in everything. Michael obeys God’s call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel’s every bitter expectation, until despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw. But with her unexpected softening comes overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. Back to the darkness, away from her husband’s pursuing love, terrified of the truth she no longer can deny: her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael does . . . the One who will never let her go. A powerful retelling of the story of Gomer and Hosea, Redeeming Love is a life-changing story of God’s unconditional, redemptive, all-consuming love.

4 Blondes,"The New York Times bestseller that “chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social aspirants, and moneyed folk [with] withering precision” (The New York Times). From the author of Sex and the City, this collection of novellas tells the stories of four women facing up to the limitations of their rapidly approaching middle age in an era that worships youth. From the former it-girl heroine of “Nice N’Easy,” who each summer looks for a rich man who’ll provide her with a house in the Hamptons, to the narrator of “Single Process,” who goes to London on a hunt for love and a good magazine story, Candace Bushnell brings to life contemporary women in search of something more—when the world is pushing for them to settle for less.

The Time Machine: An Invention,"The Time Machine is one of the most enduring works of the English language. A hundred years after it was first published, the book continues to be studied. The 1895 London first edition is used as a basis for the exhaustive annotations and other critical apparatus of the world's foremost Wellsian scholar. The widely reprinted version of 1924 is also fully accounted for. For most students, one of the chief points of interest is what the novel signified to readers when it was first published and how it relates to Wells's later works. Accordingly, the annotations focus on these questions. The introduction gives in great depth the background of the work and its complex bibliographical history, and a synopsis of the literary conventions that Wells used.",['H. G. Wells' ' Leon E.

Invisible Man (Great Books of the 20th Century),"Invisible Man is a milestone in American literature, a book that has continued to engage readers since its appearance in 1952. A first novel by an unknown writer, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen weeks, won the National Book Award for fiction, and established Ralph Ellison as one of the key writers of the century. The nameless narrator of the novel describes growing up in a black community in the South, attending a Negro college from which he is expelled, moving to New York and becoming the chief spokesman of the Harlem branch of ""the Brotherhood"", and retreating amid violence and confusion to the basement lair of the Invisible Man he imagines himself to be. The book is a passionate and witty tour de force of style, strongly influenced by T.S.

Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage,"This harrowing tale of British explorer Ernest Shackleton's 1914 attempt to reach the South Pole, one of the greatest adventure stories of the modern age. In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a skeleton crew attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. Their survival, and the survival of the men they left behind, depended on their small lifeboat successfully finding the island of South Georgia--a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean. In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.",['Alfred Lansing'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+Incredible+Voyage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2015-04-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+Incredible+Voyage&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],417,4.743405275779376,"Here are the chosen tags:

In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,"'Dick became convinced that Perry was that rarity, 'a natural killer'- absolutely sane, but conscienceless, and capable of dealing, with or without motive, the coldest-blooded deathblows' On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, a wealthy farmer, his wife and their two young children were found brutally murdered. Blood all over the walls, the telephone lines cut, and only a few dollars stolen. Heading up the investigation is Agent Al Dewey, but all he has are two footprints, four bodies, and a whole lot of questions. Truman Capote's detailed reconstruction of the events and consequences of that fateful night, In Cold Blood is a chilling, gripping mix of journalistic skill and imaginative power.

My Life in France,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Julia's story of her transformative years in France in her own words is ""captivating ... her marvelously distinctive voice is present on every page.” (San Francisco Chronicle). Although she would later singlehandedly create a new approach to American cuisine with her cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking and her television show The French Chef, Julia Child was not always a master chef. Indeed, when she first arrived in France in 1948 with her husband, Paul, who was to work for the USIS, she spoke no French and knew nothing about the country itself. But as she dove into French culture, buying food at local markets and taking classes at the Cordon Bleu, her life changed forever with her newfound passion for cooking and teaching. Julia’s unforgettable story—struggles with the head of the Cordon Bleu, rejections from publishers to whom she sent her now-famous cookbook, a wonderful, nearly fifty-year long marriage that took the Childs across the globe—unfolds with the spirit so key to Julia’s success as a chef and a writer, brilliantly capturing one of America’s most endearing personalities.","['Julia Child' ' ""Alex Prudhomme""']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=My+Life+in+France&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2006-04-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],390,4.579487179487179,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""My Life in France"":

Emotional Intelligence - Why It Can Matter More Than Iq,"#1 BESTSELLER • The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author “A thoughtfully written, persuasive account explaining emotional intelligence and why it can be crucial.”—USA Today Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren’t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time—we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.",['Daniel Goleman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OgXxhmGiRB0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OgXxhmGiRB0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emotional+Intelligence+-+Why+It+Can+Matter+More+Than+Iq&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2012-01-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OgXxhmGiRB0C&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],295,3.9694915254237286,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Emotional Intelligence - Why It Can Matter More Than IQ"" by Daniel Goleman:

Fellowship of the Ring 2ND Edition,"Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power - the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

Sense and Sensibility,"Jane Austen's first published work, meticulously constructed and sparkling with her unique wit Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love - and its threatened loss - the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.

The Fountainhead,"Her first major literary success, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an exalted view of her Objectivist philosophy, portraying a visionary artist struggling against the dull, conformist dogma of his peers; a book of ambition, power, gold and love, published in Penguin Modern Classics. Architect Howard Roark is as unyielding as the granite he blasts to build with. Defying the conventions of the world around him, he embraces a battle over two decades against a double-dealing crew of rivals who will stop at nothing to bring him down. These include, perhaps most troublesome of all, the ambitious Dominique Francon, who may just prove to be Roarke's equal. This epic story of money, power and a man's struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity's creative potential. First published in 1943, The Fountainhead introduced millions to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: an uncompromising defence of self-interest as the engine of progress, and a jubilant celebration of man's creative potential. Ayn Rand (1905-1982), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual. If you enjoued The Fountainhead, you might like Rand's Atlas Shrugged, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

Tess of the d'Urbervilles,"A heartbreaking portrayal of a woman faced by an impossible choice in the pursuit of happiness When Tess Durbeyfield is driven by family poverty to claim kinship with the wealthy D'Urbervilles and seek a portion of their family fortune, meeting her 'cousin' Alec proves to be her downfall. A very different man, Angel Clare, seems to offer her love and salvation, but Tess must choose whether to reveal her past or remain silent in the hope of a peaceful future. With its sensitive depiction of the wronged Tess and powerful criticism of social convention, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, subtitled ""A Pure Woman,"" is one of the most moving and poetic of Hardy's novels. Based on the three-volume first edition that shocked readers when first published in 1891, this edition includes as appendices: Hardy's Prefaces, the Landscapes of Tess, episodes originally censored from the Graphic periodical version, and a selection of the Graphic illustrations.

Roman Catholicism,"Are Roman Catholics REALLY Christians? This eye-opening book examines 37 main Catholic doctrines, quoting official Catholic doctrine, then compares each doctrine with the Word of God. Written in a loving style, yet without compromising, this book clearly shows the eternal destiny of those who follow the pope of Rome. If you want to talk intelligently with Catholics about their salvation, you first must know what they believe. If you are like most Christians you will be shocked when you learn what Catholicism really teaches.

The Count of Monte Cristo,"The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",['Alexandre Dumas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1846-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api,None,1667,4.55248950209958,"Here are the chosen tags:

Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,"Anne Frank hield van 12 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 een dagboek bij. Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. ""Eén enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven. Misschien moet dat ook zo zijn: als we het leed van alle mensen moesten en konden meelijden, zouden we niet kunnen leven.""

Anna Karenina - translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett,"""Anna Karenina"" is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class. Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. Constance Garnett (1861–1946) was an English translator of nineteenth-century Russian literature. Garnett was one of the first English translators of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov and introduced them on a wide basis to the English-speaking public.",['Leo Tolstoy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3VBODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3VBODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anna+Karenina+-+translated+from+the+Russian+by+Constance+Garnett&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,e-artnow,2017-11-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3VBODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],481,4.043659043659043,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Anna Karenina"" by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Constance Garnett:

The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"Agatha Christie’s first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was the result of a dare from her sister Madge who challenged her to write a story. The story begins when Hastings is sent back to England from the First World War due to injury and is invited to spend his sick leave at the beautiful Styles Court by his old friend John Cavendish. Here, Hastings meets John’s stepmother, Mrs. Inglethorp, and her new husband, Alfred. Despite the tranquil surroundings Hastings begins to realize that all is not right. When Mrs. Inglethorp is found poisoned, suspicion falls on the family, and another old friend, Hercule Poirot, is invited to investigate. Agatha Christie’s first-ever murder mystery. With impeccable timing, Hercule Poirot, the renowned Belgian detective, makes his dramatic entrance onto the English crime stage. Recently, there had been some strange goings-on at Styles St Mary. Evelyn, the constant companion to old Mrs. Inglethorp, had stormed out of the house muttering something about ‘a lot of sharks’. And with her, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt security; now the air seemed rife with suspicion and impending evil. A shattered coffee cup, a splash of candle grease, a bed of begonias... all Poirot required to display his now legendary powers of detection.",['Agatha Christie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Mysterious+Affair+at+Styles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BEYOND BOOKS HUB,1975-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z7QwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],373,4.195710455764075,"Here are the chosen tags:

Howl's Moving Castle,"This entrancing classic fantasy novel is filled with surprises at every turn. An international bestseller, this much-loved book is the source for the Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Feature. Sophie has the great misfortune of being the eldest of three daughters, destined to fail miserably should she ever leave home to seek her fate. But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howl—and herself—than first meets the eye. In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl's castle? All fans of classic fantasy books deserve the pleasure of reading those by Diana Wynne Jones, whose acclaim included the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. As Neil Gaiman stated, she was ""quite simply the best writer for children of her generation.""

A Clockwork Orange,"In de nabije toekomst maken jongeren de straten onveilig. Een van de bendeleiders wordt opgepakt maar maakt ook in detentie amok. De overheid besluit tot een wetenschappelijk experiment: geweld moet hem wezensvreemd worden. Maar niet alles verloopt volgens plan. Dit legendarische boek gaat over de vrije wil, puberteit en genetische dispositie voor misdaad en geweld. Maar ook over wanhoop, sadisme en fascisme. En wraak. Veel grotere thema's zijn er niet. Met zijn nadsat, een sociolect dat de hoofdpersonen onderling spreken, schiep Burgess bovendien een straattaal van teenagers gone bad. Ultrageweld is van alle tijden. Lees en huiver. Vijftig jaar na publicatie van het origineel verschijnt eindelijk de Nederlandse vertaling die de roman verdient.

"Lord of the Flies, a Novel","Nog altijd even opwindend en tot nadenken stemmend als toen het in 1954 verscheen, schept 'Heer van de vliegen' een gewelddadig, treff end beeld van de menselijke natuur, en wat er met deze gebeurt als de beschaving ten onder gaat. Een groep schooljongens stort neer op een onbewoond eiland. Zonder ouders of ander volwassen toezicht moeten ze met elkaar samenwerken om te overleven, waar ze jammerlijk in falen. Hun strijd om het bestaan krijgt geleidelijk steeds meer barbaarse trekken. Heer van de vliegen werd bij verschijning met lof overladen, maar commercieel succes bleef in eerste instantie uit. Geleidelijk aan werd het echter een cult-favoriet onder studenten en critici, en werd het vaak vergeleken met Salingers De vanger in het graan wat betreft invloed op de moderne literatuur.",['William Golding'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lwa2CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lwa2CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+a+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",LJ Veen Klassiek,2016-03-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lwa2CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1012,3.9377470355731226,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding:

Leaves of grass,"Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",['Walt Whitman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],552,4.27536231884058,"Here are the chosen tags:

Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].,"First published in 1926, ‘The Sun Also Rises’ is Ernest Hemingway’s first novel and a classic example of his spare but influential writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. Based on Hemingway's experiences, it is the story of a group of American and English expatriates living in Paris who take an excursion to Pamplona, Spain. The novel has forever associated Hemingway with bullfights and the running of the bulls. This powerful work of modern fiction, filled with memorable characters and universal themes, is summarized in this volume, which is enhanced by thought-provoking critical extracts and focused biographical details. The novel helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.",['Ernest Hemingway' ' Digital Fire'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8cBvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8cBvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fiesta+%5BThe+Sun+Also+Rises%5D.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,DIGITAL FIRE,2022-05-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8cBvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],543,3.871086556169429,"Here are the chosen tags:

HYPERION,"A stunning tour de force filled with transcendent awe and wonder, Hyperion is a masterwork of science fiction that resonates with excitement and invention, the first volume in a remarkable epic by the multiple-award-winning author of The Hollow Man. On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. Praise for Dan Simmons and Hyperion “Dan Simmons has brilliantly conceptualized a future 700 years distant. In sheer scope and complexity it matches, and perhaps even surpasses, those of Isaac Asimov and James Blish.”—The Washington Post Book World “An unfailingly inventive narrative . . . generously conceived and stylistically sure-handed.”—The New York Times Book Review “Simmons’s own genius transforms space opera into a new kind of poetry.”—The Denver Post “An essential part of any science fiction collection.”—Booklist",['Dan Simmons'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u4R_FstZDEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=u4R_FstZDEgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=HYPERION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Spectra,2011-01-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u4R_FstZDEgC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],531,4.278719397363465,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Hyperion"":

Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull, the most celebrated inspirational fable of our time, tells the story of a bird determined to be more than ordinary. This bestselling modern classic, reissued with a beautiful new cover design, is a story for people who want to follow their dreams and make their own rules and has inspired people for decades. `Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight how to get from shore to food and back again,' writes author Richard Bach in this allegory about a unique bird named Jonathan Livingston Seagull. `For most gulls it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.' Flight is indeed the metaphor that makes this story soar. This bestselling modern classic is a fable about seeking a higher purpose in life, even if your flock, tribe or neighbourhood finds your ambition threatening (at one point our beloved gull is even banished from his flock). By not compromising his higher vision, Jonathan learns the meaning of love and kindness and gets the ultimate payoff transcendence. The dreamy illustrations by Russell Munson provide just the right illustrations for this spirituality classic that has inspired thousands of readers to follow their own path in life and so fulfill their true potential.",['Richard Bach'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=rQVlPgAACAAJ&dq=Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2011-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=rQVlPgAACAAJ&dq=Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fables'],334,4.335329341317365,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" by Richard Bach:

The Natural,"Introduction by Kevin Baker The Natural, Bernard Malamud's first novel, published in 1952, is also the first—and some would say still the best—novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material—the story of a superbly gifted ""natural"" at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era—and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: ""Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology.""",['Bernard Malamud'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RORX2KFYTe8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=RORX2KFYTe8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Natural&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2003-07-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RORX2KFYTe8C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],301,3.877076411960133,"Here are the chosen tags:

Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah,"In the cloud-washed airspace between the cornfields of Illinois and blue infinity, a man puts his faith in the propeller of his biplane. For disillusioned writer and itinerant barnstormer Richard Bach, belief is as real as a full tank of gas and sparks firing in the cylinders...until he meets Donald Shimoda--former mechanic and self-described messiah who can make wrenches fly and Richard's imagination soar.... In Illusions, the unforgettable follow-up to his phenomenal bestseller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach takes to the air to discover the ageless truths that give our souls wings: that people don't need airplanes to soar...that even the darkest clouds have meaning once we lift ourselves above them... and that messiahs can be found in the unlikeliest places--like hay fields, one-traffic-light midwestern towns, and most of all, deep within ourselves.",['Richard Bach'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M-JBPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M-JBPgAACAAJ&dq=Illusions:+The+Adventures+of+a+Reluctant+Messiah&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1977-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=M-JBPgAACAAJ&dq=Illusions:+The+Adventures+of+a+Reluctant+Messiah&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],484,4.601239669421488,"Here are the chosen tags:

Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Hardback Library),"Jane Austen is without question, one of England's most enduring and skilled novelists. With her wit, social precision, and unerring ability to create some of literature's most charismatic and believable heroines, she mesmerises her readers as much today as when her novels were first published. Whether it is her sharp, ironic gaze at the Gothic genre invoked by the adventures of Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey; the diffident and much put-upon Fanny Price struggling to cope with her emotions in Mansfield Park; her delightfully paced comedy of manners and the machinations of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in Sense and Sensibility; the quiet strength of Anne Elliot in Persuasion succeeding in a world designed to subjugate her very existence; and Emma - 'a heroine whom no one but myself will like' teased Austen - yet another irresistible character on fire with imagination and foresight. Indeed not unlike her renowned creator. Jane Austen is as sure-footed in her steps through society's whirlpools of convention and prosaic mores as she is in her sometimes restrained but ever precise and enduring prose.",['Jane Austen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3GOFouoFqoIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3GOFouoFqoIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sense+and+Sensibility+(Wordsworth+Hardback+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wordsworth Editions,2007-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=3GOFouoFqoIC&dq=Sense+and+Sensibility+(Wordsworth+Hardback+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['England'],383,4.383812010443864,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Lord of the flies: A novel,"Golding’s iconic 1954 novel, now with a new foreword by Lois Lowry, remains one of the greatest books ever written for young adults and an unforgettable classic for readers of any age. This edition includes a new Suggestions for Further Reading by Jennifer Buehler. At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate. This far from civilization they can do anything they want. Anything. But as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far removed from reality as the hope of being rescued.",['William Golding'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3C-4dsIGlEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3C-4dsIGlEgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lord+of+the+flies:+A+novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2003-12-16,http://books.google.com/books?id=3C-4dsIGlEgC&dq=Lord+of+the+flies:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1011,3.9366963402571713,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Lord of the Flies: A Novel"" by William Golding:

Fascinating womanhood,"Over 50 years after the original book became a bestseller and birthed an international women’s movement, the sequel to Helen Andelin’s Fascinating Womanhood is here. Originally published in 1963, Fascinating Womanhood sold over 5 million copies globally and was been translated into 7 languages. As controversial as it was popular, the book also spawned a grassroots movement of classes where women could learn more about feminine influence in relationships and the home—classes that continue to this day in countries including Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Japan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The sequel Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman sees Andelin’s daughter, Dixie Andelin Forsyth, pick up her mother’s mantle with the aim of ‘awakening an enlightened form of femininity in women, in order to inspire a noble masculinity in men and create a lifelong romance.’ With teachings that lean strongly on relationship roles—focusing on division of labor between task and relationship leaders—Fascinating Womanhood has also been called “the book feminists love to hate” and there’s no doubt that its sequel is set to raise eyebrows, particularly at a time when gender norms and roles are a hot topic. While some may wonder whether these teachings have relevance within the context of a modern world, Dixie believes they have never been more important. “Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman holds the position that most cultures have lost the sense of ascendency that comes from proper cultivation of femininity and masculinity in women and men, respectively. We believe that femininity inspires a noble masculinity in men and that it empowers and liberates women to pursue their greatest potential. We teach that women are the ‘gatekeepers of civilization’ and ‘humanity’s original adults.’ We refer to something we call ‘feminine power’ which is unlocked by a ‘fascinating woman,’” Dixie says. In the years before Helen’s passing on June 7, 2009, when it became clear that she would not be able to complete her ambitions of updating the original Fascinating Womanhood book or writing its intended sequel, Helen began preparing Dixie for the task. During that time, she and her mother had broad discussions on the topics to be explored. For Helen, it was a kind of ‘life in review’, while Dixie was a seasoned teacher by this time and had lived the principles nearly her whole life. As much as she was Helen’s lifelong protégée, she was also her mother’s philosophical sparring partner and the result is that the sequel bears Dixie’s mark as much as it does Helen’s. Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman is not merely a book of personal or moral opinions. It’s based in part on modern science, over 50 years of teaching experience and feedback, and most importantly, results. While Helen’s approach to Fascinating Womanhood began as an academic exercise, with her consulting experts, authors, and other reputable sources in order to add new wisdom to her concepts, it’s evolution came about mostly through a process of application and feedback via the international teaching program. The Fascinating Womanhood blog features dramatic accounts of improved lives and marriages throughout the world. Dixie has used a similar approach with the sequel. While she too drew strongly on her experience and the feedback of the teachers and students, she also expands on new themes that her mother only touched on. With assistance from her husband Dr. Robert D. Forsyth and his research as a licensed psychologist specializing in neuropsychology, her book features pioneering information about the human brain, with a chapter devoted to practical brain architecture for better self-awareness and more effective relationship communication. The sequel also explores the male condition in much more detail, geared towards arming women with better understanding of their partners.",['Dixie Andelin Forsyth'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nUYpEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nUYpEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fascinating+womanhood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Axicon Circle, LLC",2021-02-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nUYpEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Family & Relationships'],713,3.2552594670406734,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Fascinating Womanhood"":

In dat boek volgen we de zussen Alcott, die losjes zijn gebaseerd op de schrijfster zelf en haar drie zussen. In Op eigen wieken zijn de jonge zussen uit het eerste deel opgegroeid. De kwesties waar ze mee worstelen hebben nu een ander karakter dan in hun kindertijd, en elk op hun eigen manier gaan de zussen om met het vinden van werk, een partner en het krijgen van kinderen. Na Op eigen wieken volgen nog twee delen over de levens van de familie Alcott. Het verhaal is vele malen verfilmd en op de planken gebracht. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) schreef ook voor volwassenen, maar had vooral veel succes als schrijfster van kinderboeken. Haar bekendste werk is Little Women, een autobiografische roman die nog twee vervolgboeken kreeg, en talloze malen bewerkt is tot toneelstukken en films. Alcott was ook politiek zeer actief en maakte zich onder andere sterk voor vrouwenrechten en afschaffing van de slavernij.",['Louisa May Alcott'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lZOADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lZOADwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Little+Women&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lindhardt og Ringhof,2018-12-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lZOADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3296,4.426577669902913,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Little Women"":

Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

Count of Monte Cristo,"The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",['Alexandre Dumas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Count+of+Monte+Cristo&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1846-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api,None,839,4.554231227651966,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"":

Cat's cradle (A Dell book),"“A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . .

Lucky Man: A Memoir,"A funny, highly personal, gorgeously written account of what it's like to be a 30-year-old man who is told he has an 80-year-old's disease. ""Life is great. Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap."" --Michael J. Fox In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's. Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life--from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which--with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends--he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed. The Michael J. Fox Foundation Michael J. Fox is donating the profits from his book to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is dedicated to fast-forwarding the cure for Parkinson's disease. The Foundation will move aggressively to identify the most promising research and raise the funds to assure that a cure is found for the millions of people living with this disorder. The Foundation's web site, MichaelJFox.org, carries the latest pertinent information about Parkinson's disease, including: A detailed description of Parkinson's disease How you can help find the cure Public Services Announcements that are aired on network and cable television stations across the country to increase awareness Upcoming related Parkinson's disease events and meetings Updates on recent research and developments",['Michael J.

King Rat,"Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge.

ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE,"One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.",['Gabriel Garcia Marquez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pgPWOaOctq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pgPWOaOctq8C&pg=PP1&dq=ONE+HUNDRED+YEARS+OF+SOLITUDE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2003-06-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=pgPWOaOctq8C&dq=ONE+HUNDRED+YEARS+OF+SOLITUDE&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],683,4.174231332357247,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"":

Contact,"Dit boek gaat over het gebruik van nieuwe media - internet, games en mobiele telefonie - bij kinderen in de basisschoolleeftijd. Bij kinderen draaien nieuwe media in eerste instantie om contact. Ze spelen samen met vrienden games, op spelcomputers, op spelletjeswebsites en in virtuele werelden als Stardoll.nl en Habbo. Ze bekijken filmpjes op YouTube en soms maken ze die zelf om ze vervolgens met anderen te delen. Ze hebben contact met elkaar via de mobiele telefoon en MSN. Ze 'krabbelen' elkaar op Hyves en presenteren zichzelf daar aan elkaar. Vriendschap, liefde, ruzie en pesten; alles uit het echte leven heeft ook een plaats in hun digitale leefwereld. Op steeds jongere leeftijd zijn kinderen actief met nieuwe media. Sommige ouders en leerkrachten worstelen met het mediagebruik van (jonge) kinderen. Ze vragen zich af hoe de nieuwe mogelijkheden het best benut kunnen worden en hoe gevaren vermeden kunnen worden. Wat moeten kinderen leren om veilig en efficiënt met nieuwe media om te gaan? Welke vaardigheden zijn er nodig om mediawijze burgers van hen te maken? En wat zijn hierbij taken van opvoeders? Het boek Contact! Kinderen en nieuwe media brengt het werk van de beste onderzoekers in Nederland op dit terrein samen. De auteurs genieten internationaal een uitstekende reputatie en het boek mag nu al een standaardwerk genoemd worden. Het is bij uitstek geschikt om ouders, onderwijzers en hulpverleners wegwijs te maken in de digitale leefwereld van kinderen.

Great Gatsby (Everyman),"Fitzgerald's masterpiece--the quintessential Jazz Age novel--now in a hardcover Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics edition For generations of enthralled readers, F. Scott Fitzgerald's mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby, has come to embody all the glamour and decadence of the Roaring Twenties. Gatsby emerges as if from nowhere, evading questions about his past and throwing dazzling parties sparkling with champagne and jazz at his luxurious Long Island mansion. Nick Carraway, a young man who has moved in next door, is fascinated by his oddly detached neighbor, and by his discovery that Gatsby is motivated by a single-minded quest to regain his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Nick finds something both appalling and appealing about the intensity of Gatsby's ambition to reinvent himself. But Daisy and her wealthy husband are cynical and careless people, and as Gatsby's dream collides with reality, Nick is witness to the violence and tragedy that result. The Great Gatsby's remarkable staying power, nearly a century after its publication, is owed both to the lyrical freshness of its storytelling and to the way that it illuminates the hollow core of the glittering American dream. Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket.",['F.

The count of Monte Cristo (The novels of Alexandre Dumas),"The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",['Alexandre Dumas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+count+of+Monte+Cristo+(The+novels+of+Alexandre+Dumas)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1846-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api,None,835,4.552095808383234,"Here are the chosen tags:

Upon his return to Earth, a young nurse named Jill Boardman sneaks into Smith's hospital room and shares a glass of water with him, a simple act for her but a sacred ritual on Mars. Now, connected by an incredible bond, Smith, Jill and a writer named Jubal must fight to protect a right we all take for granted: the right to love.",['Robert A.

The Hound of the Baskervilles,"When Sir Charles Baskerville dies suddenly from a heart attack, a rumour of a deadly, supernatural giant dog, who may have been persecuted for generations, begins to circulate in the village. When Sir Henry Baskerville arrives from Canada for the legacy of the Baskerville manor in England, the skeptical Sherlock Holmes is called to help with the case. Was the death of Sir Charles Baskerville really a heart attack or maybe an animal lurking in deserted moors? Will Baskerville's new owner become the next victim of the dog? The Hound of the Baskervilles is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's third Sherlock Holmes novel. The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of Doyle's most famous works and has been adapted for the big screen more than 20 times. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was a British writer, best known for his thrilling stories about the adventures of the detective Sherlock Holmes. He published four novels and more than 50 short stories starring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The stories are seen as important milestones in the history of crime fiction.",['Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hRfZDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hRfZDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hound+of+the+Baskervilles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lindhardt og Ringhof,2020-10-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hRfZDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],468,4.004273504273504,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"":

The Complete Sherlock Holmes,"A master of deductive reasoning who can solve the most difficult crimes by spotting obscure clues overlooked by others, dilettante sleuth Sherlock Holmes was the hero of 60 stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle between 1887 and 1927. With the help of his loyal friend, Doctor Watson, Holmes brought countless crooks, thieves, swindlers, and murderers to justice. He even rose from the dead after Doyle tried to dispatch him in his twenty-fourth adventure, and readers protested. Some Sherlock Holmes stories rank among the most famous in detective fiction, among them ""A Study in Scarlet,"" ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" ""The Speckled Band,"" and ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" Here, in one volume, are all four full-length novels and 56 short stories about the colorful adventures of Sherlock Holmes--every word Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Baker Street's most famous resident. Also included is an introduction by lifetime Sherlockians Barbara and Christopher Roden. The Complete Sherlock Holmes is one of Barnes & Noble's Collectible Editions classics. Each volume features authoritative texts by the world's greatest authors in an exquisitely designed bonded-leather binding, with distinctive gilt edging and a ribbon bookmark. Decorative, durable, and collectible, these books offer hours of pleasure to readers young and old and are an indispensable cornerstone for every home library.",['Arthur Conan Doyle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FTeJtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FTeJtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2018-02-26,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FTeJtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes&hl=&source=gbs_api,None,420,4.397619047619048,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""The Complete Sherlock Holmes"":

Persuasion (Penguin Audio Classics),"Jane Austen’s last completed novel, a brilliantly insightful story of regret, second chances, and the courage to follow our hearts Anne Elliot is twenty-seven and unmarried—by all accounts a spinster in her time—seemingly doomed to spend the rest of her life waiting on her image-obsessed father and extravagant older sister; attempting to maintain their once lavish, now dwindling family estate; and occasionally babysitting the children of her married younger sister. It wasn’t always this way, though. When Anne was nineteen, she was in love with and engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no money and few prospects. Anne’s well-meaning family and friends convinced her that a young heiress like herself could do better, so she broke off the engagement. But when chance brings Wentworth and Anne together again eight years later, he is now an accomplished naval captain with an impressive fortune, and Anne must face her feelings for him that remain and consider how different her life could have been if only she hadn’t been so easily persuaded by others.",['Jane Austen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Persuasion+(Penguin+Audio+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2011-06-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ynsrdImzs5QC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],398,4.366834170854271,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Colorado Kid,"Stephen King's bestselling unsolved mystery, THE COLORADO KID -- inspiration for the TV series HAVEN -- returns to bookstores for the first time in 10 years in an all-new illustrated edition. On an island off the coast of Maine, a man is found dead. There's no identification on the body. Only the dogged work of a pair of local newspapermen and a graduate student in forensics turns up any clues, and it's more than a year before the man is identified. And that's just the beginning of the mystery. Because the more they learn about the man and the baffling circumstances of his death, the less they understand. Was it an impossible crime? Or something stranger still...? No one but Stephen King could tell this story about the darkness at the heart of the unknown and our compulsion to investigate the unexplained. With echoes of Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON and the work of Graham Greene, one of the world's great storytellers presents a moving and surprising tale whose subject is nothing less than the nature of mystery itself...",['Stephen King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DPlOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DPlOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Colorado+Kid&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Titan Books (US, CA)",2019-05-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=DPlOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Colorado+Kid&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],387,3.1214470284237725,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""The Colorado Kid"" by Stephen King:

Lord of the flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['William Golding'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r6eoCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=r6eoCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lord+of+the+flies&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2016-11-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r6eoCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2031,3.9394387001477105,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Lord of the Flies"":

The Talisman,"The iconic, “extraordinary” (The Washington Post) collaboration between bestselling authors Stephen King and Peter Straub—an epic thriller about a young boy’s quest to save his mother’s life. Jack Sawyer, twelve years old, is about to begin a most fantastic journey, an exalting, terrifying quest for the mystical Talisman—the only thing that can save Jack’s dying mother. But to reach his goal, Jack must make his way not only across the breadth of the United States but also through the wondrous and menacing parallel world of the Territories. In the Territories, Jack finds another realm, where the air is so sweet and clear a man can smell a radish being pulled from the ground a mile away—and a life can be snuffed out instantly in the continuing struggle between good and evil. Here Jack discovers “Twinners,” reflections of the people he knows on earth—most notably Queen Laura, the Twinner of Jack’s own imperiled mother. As Jack “flips” between worlds, making his way westward toward the redemptive Talisman, a sequence of heart-stopping encounters challenges him at every step.

Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood--the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, The Red Tent combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.",['Anita Diamant'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4AdKq7LlZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=P4AdKq7LlZcC&dq=The+Red+Tent+(Bestselling+Backlist)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Picador,1998-09-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=P4AdKq7LlZcC&dq=The+Red+Tent+(Bestselling+Backlist)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1428,4.184173669467787,"Here are the chosen tags:

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry Into Values,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live.

Psycho-Cybernetics,"Cybernetics (loosely translated from the Greek): “a helmsman who steers his ship to port.” Psycho-Cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means, “steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the greatest port in the world, peace of mind.” Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz’s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz’s message even more relevant for the contemporary reader. “Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.” —Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power) Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual’s ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) any goal. And he developed techniques for improving and managing self-image—visualization, mental rehearsal, relaxation—which have informed and inspired countless motivational gurus, sports psychologists, and self-help practitioners for more than fifty years. The teachings of Psycho-Cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results.",['Maxwell Maltz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psycho-Cybernetics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2015-11-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psycho-Cybernetics&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],524,4.687022900763359,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Psycho-Cybernetics"":

The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century),"This carefully crafted ebook: ""The Bell Jar"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Esther Greenwood, a young woman from the suburbs of Boston, gains a summer internship at a prominent magazine in New York City, under editor Jay Cee; however, Esther is neither stimulated nor excited by either the big city or the glamorous culture and lifestyle that girls her age are expected to idolize and emulate. She instead finds her experience to be frightening and disorienting. From hereafter her mental state keeps deteriorating until she starts feeling helpless as if being kept inside a glass bell jar! The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas"" in 1963, the novel is semi-autobiographical, with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a roman à clef because the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother.",['Sylvia Plath'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bell+Jar+(Great+Books+of+the+20th+Century)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,e-artnow,2018-07-29,http://books.google.com/books?id=INCSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bell+Jar+(Great+Books+of+the+20th+Century)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],500,4.428,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""The Bell Jar"" by Sylvia Plath:

Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Currency,2010-08-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],629,4.378378378378378,"Here are the chosen tags:

Jane Eyre (Simple English),"Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as a burden, and Mrs. Reed discourages her three children from associating with Jane. Jane, as a result, becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only a doll and books with which to entertain herself.One day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the red room in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the ""ambiguous relationship between parents and children"" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.",['Charlotte Brontë'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_-pezgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_-pezgEACAAJ&dq=Jane+Eyre+(Simple+English)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2021-03-23,http://books.google.com/books?id=_-pezgEACAAJ&dq=Jane+Eyre+(Simple+English)&hl=&source=gbs_api,None,1190,4.550420168067227,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Anna Karenina,"The must-have Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of one of the greatest Russian novels ever written Described by William Faulkner as the best novel ever written and by Fyodor Dostoevsky as “flawless,” Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This authoritative edition, which received the PEN Translation Prize and was an Oprah Book Club™ selection, also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this Anna Karenina will be the definitive text for fans of the film and generations to come. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

"The fountainhead,","Her first major literary success, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an exalted view of her Objectivist philosophy, portraying a visionary artist struggling against the dull, conformist dogma of his peers; a book of ambition, power, gold and love, published in Penguin Modern Classics. Architect Howard Roark is as unyielding as the granite he blasts to build with. Defying the conventions of the world around him, he embraces a battle over two decades against a double-dealing crew of rivals who will stop at nothing to bring him down. These include, perhaps most troublesome of all, the ambitious Dominique Francon, who may just prove to be Roarke's equal. This epic story of money, power and a man's struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity's creative potential. First published in 1943, The Fountainhead introduced millions to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: an uncompromising defence of self-interest as the engine of progress, and a jubilant celebration of man's creative potential. Ayn Rand (1905-1982), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual. If you enjoued The Fountainhead, you might like Rand's Atlas Shrugged, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

STEPHEN HAWKING'S A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME,"Was there a beginning of time? Could time run backwards? Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world's greatest thinkers. It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory. To this day A Brief History of Time remains a staple of the scientific canon, and its succinct and clear language continues to introduce millions to the universe and its wonders.",['Stephen Hawking'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xCvztgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xCvztgAACAAJ&dq=STEPHEN+HAWKING%27S+A+BRIEF+HISTORY+OF+TIME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam Press,2011-08-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=xCvztgAACAAJ&dq=STEPHEN+HAWKING%27S+A+BRIEF+HISTORY+OF+TIME&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],313,4.210862619808307,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking:

Man's Search for Meaning,"A prominent Viennese psychiatrist before the war, Viktor Frankl was uniquely able to observe the way that he and other inmates coped with the experience of being in Auschwitz. He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph. Frankl came to believe that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.",['Viktor E Frankl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SEsIPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SEsIPQAACAAJ&dq=Man%27s+Search+for+Meaning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2008-02-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SEsIPQAACAAJ&dq=Man%27s+Search+for+Meaning&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Existential psychotherapy'],2433,4.73612823674476,"Here are the chosen tags:

THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,"Anyone who has read J. D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.",['J.D.

Tis: A Memoir,"Frank McCourt’s glorious childhood memoir, Angela’s Ashes, has been loved and celebrated by readers everywhere for its spirit, its wit and its profound humanity. A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape. And now we have ’Tis, the story of Frank’s American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this “classless country,” and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank’s incomparable voice—his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue—that renders these experiences spellbinding. When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should “stick to their own kind” once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach—and to write—that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angela’s Ashes comes of age. As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angela’s Ashes, “It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best.” Frank McCourt's ’Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.",['Frank McCourt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kI2EQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kI2EQAAACAAJ&dq=Tis:+A+Memoir&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Scribner,2000-08-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=kI2EQAAACAAJ&dq=Tis:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],463,3.90280777537797,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Tis: A Memoir"" by Frank McCourt:

Silent Spring,"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring alerted a large audience to the environmental and human dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides, spurring revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Lord Shackleton, a preface by World Wildlife Fund founder Julian Huxley, and an afterword by Carson's biographer Linda Lear. Now recognized as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, Silent Spring exposed the destruction of wildlife through the widespread use of pesticides. Despite condemnation in the press and heavy-handed attempts by the chemical industry to ban the book, Rachel Carson succeeded in creating a new public awareness of the environment which led to changes in government and inspired the ecological movement. It is thanks to this book, and the help of many environmentalists, that harmful pesticides such as DDT were banned from use in the US and countries around the world. Rachel Carson (1907-64) wanted to be a writer for as long as she could remember. Her first book, Under the Sea Wind, appeared in 1941. Silent Spring, which alerted the world to the dangers of the misuse of pesticides, was published in 1962. Carson's articles on natural history appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker, Reader's Digest and Holiday. An ardent ecologist and preservationist, Carson warned against the dumping of atomic waste at sea and predicted global warming. If you enjoyed Silent Spring, you might like John Christopher's The Death of Grass, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

Endurance: Shackleton's incredible voyage,"This harrowing tale of British explorer Ernest Shackleton's 1914 attempt to reach the South Pole, one of the greatest adventure stories of the modern age. In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a skeleton crew attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. Their survival, and the survival of the men they left behind, depended on their small lifeboat successfully finding the island of South Georgia--a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean. In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.",['Alfred Lansing'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+incredible+voyage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2015-04-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+incredible+voyage&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],416,4.742788461538462,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage"":

NEW EARTH,"The 10th anniversary edition of A New Earth with a new preface by Eckhart Tolle. With his bestselling spiritual guide The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle inspired millions of readers to discover the freedom and joy of a life lived “in the now.” In A New Earth, Tolle expands on these powerful ideas to show how transcending our ego-based state of consciousness is not only essential to personal happiness, but also the key to ending conflict and suffering throughout the world. Tolle describes how our attachment to the ego creates the dysfunction that leads to anger, jealousy, and unhappiness, and shows readers how to awaken to a new state of consciousness and follow the path to a truly fulfilling existence. Illuminating, enlightening, and uplifting, A New Earth is a profoundly spiritual manifesto for a better way of life—and for building a better world.",['Eckhart Tolle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JScjn-NRFaUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JScjn-NRFaUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=NEW+EARTH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2006-08-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JScjn-NRFaUC&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],1798,4.200222469410456,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""NEW EARTH"" by Eckhart Tolle:

The Lincoln Lawyer,"This #1 bestselling legal thriller from Michael Connelly is a stunning display of novelistic mastery - as human, as gripping, and as whiplash-surprising as any novel yet from the writer Publishers Weekly has called ""today's Dostoevsky of crime literature."" Mickey Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer, a criminal defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, traveling between the far-flung courthouses of Los Angeles to defend clients of every kind. Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers - they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence, it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice. A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career. Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal - this time to save his own life.",['Michael Connelly'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZoibWwaSNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bZoibWwaSNoC&q=The+Lincoln+Lawyer&dq=The+Lincoln+Lawyer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Grand Central Publishing,2008-09-16,http://books.google.com/books?id=bZoibWwaSNoC&dq=The+Lincoln+Lawyer&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],645,4.530232558139535,"Here are the chosen tags:

A confederacy of dunces,"One of the BBC's '100 Novels That Shaped Our World' 'My favourite book of all time... it stays with you long after you have read it - for your whole life, in fact' Billy Connolly A monument to sloth, rant and contempt, a behemoth of fat, flatulence and furious suspicion of anything modern - this is Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, noble crusader against a world of dunces. The ordinary folk of New Orleans seem to think he is unhinged. Ignatius ignores them, heaving his vast bulk through the city's fleshpots in a noble crusade against vice, modernity and ignorance. But his momma has a nasty surprise in store for him: Ignatius must get a job. Undaunted, he uses his new-found employment to further his mission - and now he has a pirate costume and a hot-dog cart to do it with... Never published during his lifetime, John Kennedy Toole's hilarious satire, A Confederacy of Dunces is a Don Quixote for the modern age, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition includes a foreword by Walker Percy.

With No One As Witness (Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Novels),"“Delicately textured. . . achingly compassionate. . . gripping. . . . It’s one of George’s best, and that’s saying something.” —Seattle Times The #1 New York Times bestselling author’s chilling 13th novel in the Inspector Lynley series Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley faces the greatest challenge of his career. When an adolescent boy’s nude body is found draped over a tomb in a graveyard, the police recognize the work of a serial killer who’s been murdering boys in London. This is the killer’s fourth victim but the first to be white. Hoping to avoid charges of institutionalized prejudice in their failure to pursue the earlier crimes to their conclusion, New Scotland Yard takes the case and hands it over to Lynley and his colleagues Detective Constable Barbara Havers and Detective Sergeant Winston Nkata. The killer is a psychopath who does not intend to be stopped. But a devastating tragedy within their ranks causes the police to fumble in their pursuit, which may bring more fatal consequences.",['Elizabeth George'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gPxhcuQik-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gPxhcuQik-UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=With+No+One+As+Witness+(Thomas+Lynley+and+Barbara+Havers+Novels)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gPxhcuQik-UC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],273,3.5641025641025643,"Here are the chosen tags for the book:

Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig,"The definitive account of the life and tragic death of baseball legend Lou Gehrig. Lou Gehrig was a baseball legend—the Iron Horse, the stoic New York Yankee who was the greatest first baseman in history, a man whose consecutive-games streak was ended by a horrible disease that now bears his name. But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig’s life was more complicated—and, perhaps, even more heroic—than anyone really knew. Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig’s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous “luckiest man” speech. Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig’s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we’ve never seen him before.",['Jonathan Eig'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cSA7UvX_7T0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cSA7UvX_7T0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Luckiest+Man:+The+Life+and+Death+of+Lou+Gehrig&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cSA7UvX_7T0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],306,4.676470588235294,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1),"A gripping and prescient tale from New York Times best selling author Joel C. Rosenberg. ""... The Last Jihad absolutely crackles with high energy and a chilling premise--what if the war on terror goes nuclear."" -- Rush Limbaugh Jon Bennett is a top Wall Street strategist turned senior White House advisor. But nothing has prepared him for the terror that he will face. Saddam Hussein dispatches his top hit men to assassinate the President of the United States. Iraqi terrorists spread carnage throughout London, Paris, and Riyadh . . . and the Butcher of Baghdad has a nuclear ace in his hand that he has not yet played. Only a solid Arab-Isreali coalition against Iraq can keep the U.S.--and other Western nations--from certain devastation. And only Bennett and his beautiful partner, Erin McCoy, can make that happen. Their secret project--a billion-dollar oil deal off the coast of Gaza--could be the basis for an historic peace treaty and enormous wealth for every Isreali and Palestinian. But just before a treaty can be signed, Isreali commandos foil an Iraqi Scud missile launch, recovering a nuclear warhead and evidence that the next attack will level Washington, New York and Tel Aviv. Now, the Isreali Prime Minister gives the American President an ultimatum: Melt down Baghdad within one hour . . . or Israel will do it herself. From Jerusalem, Bennett and McCoy must summon all their stealth and savvy to save themselves--and the world--from absolute destruction.

The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,"The classic personal account of Watson and Crick’s groundbreaking discovery of the structure of DNA, now with an introduction by Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind. By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry and won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science’s greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick’s desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.",['James D.

The Lies of Locke Lamora,"They say that the Thorn of Camorr can beat anyone in a fight. They say he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. They say he's part man, part myth, and mostly street-corner rumor. And they are wrong on every count. Only averagely tall, slender, and god-awful with a sword, Locke Lamora is the fabled Thorn, and the greatest weapons at his disposal are his wit and cunning. He steals from the rich - they're the only ones worth stealing from - but the poor can go steal for themselves. What Locke cons, wheedles and tricks into his possession is strictly for him and his band of fellow con-artists and thieves: the Gentleman Bastards. Together their domain is the city of Camorr. Built of Elderglass by a race no-one remembers, it's a city of shifting revels, filthy canals, baroque palaces and crowded cemeteries. Home to Dons, merchants, soldiers, beggars, cripples, and feral children. And to Capa Barsavi, the criminal mastermind who runs the city. But there are whispers of a challenge to the Capa's power. A challenge from a man no one has ever seen, a man no blade can touch. The Grey King is coming. A man would be well advised not to be caught between Capa Barsavi and The Grey King. Even such a master of the sword as the Thorn of Camorr. As for Locke Lamora ...",['Scott Lynch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QgI5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QgI5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Lies+of+Locke+Lamora&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette Book Group,2008-09-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=QgI5AgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Lies+of+Locke+Lamora&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],303,4.247524752475248,"Here are the chosen tags:

How to Make Love Like a Porn Star CD: A Cautionary Tale,"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, the mega-bestselling memoir, triumphant survival story, and cautionary tale that spent over six weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and rocketed adult film icon Jenna Jameson into the mainstream spotlight, is now in paperback and ebook for the very first time. Her unforgettable memoir, written with master storyteller Neil Strauss, is many things at once: a shocking sexual history; an insider's guide to the secret workings of the billion-dollar adult-film industry; and a gripping thriller that probes deep into Jameson's dark past. With never-before-seen photographs from Jenna's private collection, exclusive photos taken for this book, and original cartoon strips, this memoir is an unparalleled exploration of sexual freedom. In the underbelly of Las Vegas, a cesspool of warring biker gangs and seedy strip clubs, gawky, brace-faced Jenna Massoli was transformed into the bombshell Jenna Jameson. Today, Jenna is the biggest star in the history of adult movies, consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful women alive. But behind the glamour and the meteoric rise to fame was a path paved with tragedy and heartbreak. As a teenager—drawn into a dark and chaotic world where rape, abuse, and murder were commonplace—Jenna began her rapid downward spiral of addiction and degradation . . . while at the same time becoming the porn world's biggest crossover success story.",['Jenna Jameson' ' Neil Strauss'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FbGzc4L6aMkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FbGzc4L6aMkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+Make+Love+Like+a+Porn+Star+CD:+A+Cautionary+Tale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2012-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FbGzc4L6aMkC&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],325,4.04,"Here are the tags that fit best for the given book:

Saucer,"Stephen Coonts has earned an extraordinary worldwide reputation with his military thrillers featuring Jake Grafton, one of the most popular and recognizable characters in contemporary suspense fiction. In this exhilarating departure, Coonts takes readers on an imaginative journey into space that is as suspenseful as any of his other stories . . . When Rip Cantrell, a seismic survey worker in the Sahara, spots a glint of reflected light in the distance, he investigates-and finds a piece of metal apparently entombed in the sandstone. Before long, Rip and his colleagues uncover a flying saucer that has been resting there for 140,000 years. Their discovery doesn't remain a secret for long. The U.S. airforce sends a UFO investigation team, which arrives just minutes before a team sent by an Australian billionaire to steal the saucer's secrets. Before either side can outwit the other, the Libyan military arrives. Meanwhile, Rip has been checking out the saucer. With the help of a beautiful ex-Air Force test pilot Charley Pine, Rip flies the saucer away, embarking on a fantastic journey into space and around the world, keeping just ahead of those who want the saucer for themselves. Saucer is a dazzling flying story and an action-filled look at what might have been...and what might be.",['Stephen Coonts'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FjlzPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FjlzPgAACAAJ&dq=Saucer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Griffin,2002-03-08,http://books.google.com/books?id=FjlzPgAACAAJ&dq=Saucer&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],267,3.191011235955056,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Saucer"":

The Dance of Anger: A Woman's Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships,"The renowned classic and New York Times bestseller Anger is something we feel. It exists for a reason and always deserves our respect and attention. We all have a right to everything we feel—and certainly our anger is no exception. ""Anger is a signal and one worth listening to,"" writes Dr. Harriet Lerner in her renowned classic that has transformed the lives of millions of readers. While anger deserves our attention and respect, women still learn to silence our anger, to deny it entirely, or to vent it in a way that leaves us feeling helpless and powerless.

What Is the What,"What Is the What is the story of Valentino Achak Deng, a refugee in war-ravaged southern Sudan who flees from his village in the mid-1980s and becomes one of the so-called Lost Boys. Valentino’s travels bring him in contact with enemy soldiers, with liberation rebels, with hyenas and lions, with disease and starvation, and with deadly murahaleen (militias on horseback)–the same sort who currently terrorize Darfur. Eventually Deng is resettled in the United States with almost 4000 other young Sudanese men, and a very different struggle begins. Based closely on true experiences, What Is the What is heartbreaking and arresting, filled with adventure, suspense, tragedy, and, finally, triumph.",['Dave Eggers'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3HDpzQhWIxAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3HDpzQhWIxAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=What+Is+the+What&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage Canada,2009-02-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=3HDpzQhWIxAC&dq=What+Is+the+What&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],264,4.6022727272727275,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""What Is the What"":

BEACH ROAD,"Dark mysteries come to East Hampton while a struggling lawyer fights to save his friend from being framed for a triple murder. Montauk lawyer Tom Dunleavy's client list is woefully small-occasional real estate closings barely keep him in paper clips. So when he is hired to defend a local man accused in a triple murder in East Hampton, he knows that he has found the case of his lifetime. The crime turns the glittering playground for the super-rich into a blazing inferno. Dunleavy's client is a local hero, but he knows the case rests on money, deception, and forbidden desires. His client will be framed-unless he can find the key to the case. When Dunleavy is joined by his former flame, the savvy and well-connected attorney, Kate Costello, he believes he has a chance. But payback is a bitch, especially from the rich. The violent retaliations of billionaires threatened by his investigation exceed anything Dunleavy has ever seen. With the entire nation's eyes on him in a new Trial of the Century, Dunleavy orchestrates a series of revelations that lead to a stunning outcome-and the truth is wilder than anything he ever imagined.",['James Patterson' ' Peter de Jonge'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CPG6o9eyMMEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CPG6o9eyMMEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=BEACH+ROAD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Little, Brown",2006-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CPG6o9eyMMEC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],304,2.8914473684210527,"Here are the tags that fit best:

When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management,"“A riveting account that reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.”—The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUSINESSWEEK In this business classic—now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis—Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall. When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored. Praise for When Genius Failed “[Roger] Lowenstein has written a squalid and fascinating tale of world-class greed and, above all, hubris.”—BusinessWeek “Compelling . . . The fund was long cloaked in secrecy, making the story of its rise . . . and its ultimate destruction that much more fascinating.”—The Washington Post “Story-telling journalism at its best.”—The Economist",['Roger Lowenstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=When+Genius+Failed:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Long-Term+Capital+Management&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2001-10-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=-xgOQ6jnQooC&dq=When+Genius+Failed:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Long-Term+Capital+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],263,4.532319391634981,"Here are the chosen tags:

Blessings,"Blessings and Miracles in the perspective of a relationship with God and His divine intervention in our lives, we learn how different factors contribute consequently to the quality of life we live. The actions, choices, and attitudes we have and express every day affect how the blessings and miracles accomplish their purpose in our lives. Blessings and Miracles have been and are still a medium for God to work in our lives. God performs miracles for us to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and through having faith in Him, we experience eternal life by the power of His Name (John 20:30-31). Blessings are, in most cases, conditional and received through a process. A blessing can also be a resource, a resource is a source of supply or support, and it is again an available means or productive factor required to accomplish a given activity. Therefore, blessings are supposed to help us achieve the purpose of our life in this world. It is the Father’s good pleasure to have a relationship with you, to bless you, to heal you, and give you a complete restoration. A miracle is applicable in a crisis or in a problem that we can avoid, or that is unavoidable. While with God’s blessings, we can avoid a position that would put us in a crisis in the first place when we apply godly principles, take the right actions, and have the right choices. God wants us to live a life full of blessings (Barak). Having a relationship with Him, living by His principles, having the right character, and living by His Word for our welfare.",['Stephen Mugabo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=95_TDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=95_TDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&dq=Blessings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,WestBow Press,2020-02-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=95_TDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],263,3.806083650190114,"Here are the chosen tags:

QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life,"The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, victim thinking, complaining, and procrastination. No organization—or individual—can successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability. John G. Miller believes that the troubles that plague organizations cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In QBQ! The Question Behind the Question®, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like “Why do we have to go through all this change?” and “Who dropped the ball?” represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questions—QBQs—such as “What can I do to contribute?” or “How can I help solve the problem?” our lives and our organizations are transformed. THE QBQ! PROMISE This remarkable and timely book provides a practical method for putting personal accountability into daily actions, with astonishing results: problems are solved, internal barriers come down, service improves, teams thrive, and people adapt to change more quickly. QBQ! is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to learn, grow, and change. Using this tool, each of us can add tremendous worth to our organizations and to our lives by eliminating blame, victim-thinking, and procrastination. QBQ! was written more than a decade ago and has helped countless readers practice personal accountability at work and at home. This version features a new foreword, revisions and new material throughout, and a section of FAQs that the author has received over the years.",['John G.

Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang,"In 1998, William Queen was a veteran law enforcement agent with a lifelong love of motorcycles and a lack of patience with paperwork. When a “confidential informant” made contact with his boss at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, offering to take an agent inside the San Fernando chapter of the Mongols (the scourge of Southern California, and one of the most dangerous gangs in America), Queen jumped at the chance, not realizing that he was kicking-starting the most extensive undercover operation inside an outlaw motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement. Nor did Queen suspect that he would penetrate the gang so successfully that he would become a fully “patched-in” member, eventually rising through their ranks to the office of treasurer, where he had unprecedented access to evidence of their criminal activity. After Queen spent twenty-eight months as “Billy St. John,” the bearded, beer-swilling, Harley-riding gang-banger, the truth of his identity became blurry, even to himself. During his initial “prospecting” phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol “ol’ lady” after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend. Yet despite the constant criminality of the gang, for whom planning cop killings and gang rapes were business as usual, Queen also came to see the genuine camaraderie they shared. When his lengthy undercover work totally isolated Queen from family, his friends, and ATF colleagues, the Mongols felt like the only family he had left. “I had no doubt these guys genuinely loved Billy St. John and would have laid down their lives for him. But they wouldn’t hesitate to murder Billy Queen.” From Queen’s first sleight of hand with a line of methamphetamine in front of him and a knife at his throat, to the fearsome face-off with their decades-old enemy, the Hell’s Angels (a brawl that left three bikers dead), to the heartbreaking scene of a father ostracized at Parents’ Night because his deranged-outlaw appearance precluded any interaction with regular citizens, Under and Alone is a breathless, adrenaline-charged read that puts you on the street with some of the most dangerous men in America and with the law enforcement agents who risk everything to bring them in.",['William Queen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Under+and+Alone:+The+True+Story+of+the+Undercover+Agent+Who+Infiltrated+America%27s+Most+Violent+Outlaw+Motorcycle+Gang&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2005-04-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfqvVuqSm-gC&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],300,4.626666666666667,"Here are the chosen tags:

What Came Before He Shot Her,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth George delivers an explosive, ""absolutely riveting"" novel (Entertainment Weekly) that delves into the events leading up to the shocking murder of Inspector Lynley’s wife. The brutal, inexplicable death of Inspector Thomas Lynley’s wife, Helen, has left Scotland Yard shocked and searching for answers. Even more horrifying is that the trigger was apparently pulled by a twelve-year-old boy. That story begins on the other side of London in rough North Kensington, where the three, mixed-race, virtually orphaned Campbell children are bounced first from their grandmother to their aunt. The oldest, fifteen-year-old Ness, is headed for trouble as fast as her high-heeled boots will take her. That leaves the middle child, Joel, to care for the youngest, Toby. No one wants to put it into words, but something clearly isn’t right with Toby. Before long, there are signs that Joel himself has problems. A local gang starts harassing him and threatening his brother. To protect his family, Joel ends up making a pact with the devil—a move that leads straight to the front doorstep of Thomas Lynley. The anatomy of a murder, the story of a family in crisis, What Came Before He Shot Her is a powerful and emotional novel, full of deep psychological insights, that only the incomparable Elizabeth George could write.",['Elizabeth George'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89jiZroQ7WIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=89jiZroQ7WIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=What+Came+Before+He+Shot+Her&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=89jiZroQ7WIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],316,3.1012658227848102,"Here are the chosen tags:

A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present,"This is a new edition of the radical social history of America from Columbus to the present. This powerful and controversial study turns orthodox American history upside down to portray the social turmoil behind the ""march of progress"". Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of - and in the words of - America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of America's greatest battles - the fights for fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality - were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through the Clinton years A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, is an insightful analysis of the most important events in US history.",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iMJcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iMJcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+People%27s+History+of+the+United+States:+1492+to+Present&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2015-08-12,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iMJcCgAAQBAJ&dq=A+People%27s+History+of+the+United+States:+1492+to+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],353,3.8753541076487252,"Here are the chosen tags:

Wish You Well,"Dit is het aangrijpende verhaal van de twaalfjarige Louisa Mae Cardinal, die in New York woont met haar verlegen broertje Oz. Het is 1940 en ze hebben het niet gemakkelijk, want het inkomen van hun vader, die schrijver is, is niet hoog. Maar dat kan Lou niet zoveel schelen, want ze aanbidt haar vader en is gek op zijn verhalen. Maar dan, in één verschrikkelijk moment, verandert Lou's leven voorgoed. Een auto-ongeluk maakt een einde aan hun vaders leven, waardoor zij en Oz moeten verhuizen naar het verre Virginia. Daar, in het isolement van de desolate bergen, komen ze te wonen bij hun excentrieke overgrootmoeder Louisa, Lou's naamgenote. Geplaatst tegenover nieuwe verantwoordelijkheden ziet Lou zich gedwongen snel volwassen te worden. Daar, op haar overgrootmoeders eenvoudige boerderij, op het land waarvan haar vader zo hield en waarover hij steeds weer schreef, ontdekt zij wie zij werkelijk is en wat zij kan betekenen voor deze wereld. En wanneer een vernietigend noodlot hun nieuwe huis treft kan zij de strijd die volgt het hoofd bieden; een strijd die gaat om recht en overleving en die gestreden wordt in een overvolle rechtszaal in Virginia...",['David Baldacci'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UE3sCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UE3sCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Wish+You+Well&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A.W.

The Little Book That Beats the Market,"In 2005, Joel Greenblatt published a book that is already considered one of the classics of finance literature. In The Little Book that Beats the Market—a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print—Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author’s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You’ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone “knows” it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market. As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition, “Mr. Greenblatt…says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His ‘Little Book’ is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.”",['Joel Greenblatt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G5RyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=G5RyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Little+Book+That+Beats+the+Market&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,John Wiley & Sons,2010-09-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=G5RyDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Little+Book+That+Beats+the+Market&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],281,3.7295373665480427,"Here are the tags that fit best:

Three Men in a Boat,"George, J., Harris and Montmorency, the dog, are the best of friends. Armed with interesting anecdotes, their quirky personalities and a boat, the three men and the dog decide to go on a boat trip across river Thames. But they discover that their fancy ideas of a boat trip, which includes visits to many famous riverside towns of England in the 19th-century, are very different from the reality! Jerome K Jerome's three men in a Boat is a comic tale of friendship, misadventure and fun. It is a delightful story for all ages and seasons. Hidden within the seemingly funny incidents and comments are the writer's opinions on the foibles in England's history and society. The book offers a refreshing look at the various places, people and mannerisms in the country.",['Jerome K.

"LAST COYOTE (HARRY BOSCH, NO 4)","Harry attacked his commanding officer and is suspended indefinitely, pending a psychiatric evaluation. At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time. In 1961, when Harry was twelve, his mother, a prostitute, was brutally murdered, and no one has ever been accused of the crime. With the spare time a suspension brings, Harry opens up the thirty-year-old file on the case and is irresistibly drawn into a past he has always avoided. It's clear that the case was fumbled and the smell of a cover-up is unmistakable. Someone powerful was able to divert justice and Harry vows to uncover the truth. As he relentlessly follows the broken pieces of the case, the stirred interest causes new murders and pushes Harry to the edge of his job... and his life.",['Michael Connelly'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SPCGmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SPCGmgEACAAJ&dq=LAST+COYOTE+(HARRY+BOSCH,+NO+4)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Grand Central Publishing,2013-10-15,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SPCGmgEACAAJ&dq=LAST+COYOTE+(HARRY+BOSCH,+NO+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Fiction'],269,4.483271375464684,"Here are the chosen tags:

Wuthering Heights,"Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. HeathcliffÕs dwelling. ÔWutheringÕ being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date Ô1500,Õ and the name ÔHareton Earnshaw.Õ I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here Ôthe houseÕ pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",['Emily Bronte'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wuthering+Heights&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&source=gbs_api,None,8660,4.095727482678984,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Wuthering Heights"":

"Economics in one lesson,","With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&pg=PP1&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Currency,2010-08-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],316,4.379746835443038,"Here are the chosen tags:

The Traveler,"Some events change the course of the world, but do people know, when they’re living through such events, that they will become part of history? Sent ahead to secure her merchant caravan a place in the next village, Sedra took a shortcut through the familiar ruins she used to play in as a child -- but found a magical attack waiting for her instead of memories. No trace of her encounter remains except the strange dancing lights that only she can see and the debilitating headaches she’s had ever since, but she can’t go back to her normal life and pretend it didn’t happen. The Travelers, who have dedicated their lives to roaming the world and helping those in need, are Sedra’s only hope of finding out who attacked her and why. They may be her people’s only hope in the dark days yet to come. Sorcery isn’t practiced anymore in the Land of Sunsets, but there is a rising power in the Circle of the World and those who can bend it to their will are willing to go to any lengths to get more power. The attack on Sedra is just the beginning.",['Noor Al-Shanti'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfhjEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YfhjEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT130&dq=The+Traveler&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Noor Al-Shanti,2022-03-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YfhjEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],273,4.304029304029304,"Here are the tags that fit best:

The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,"For fans of Artemis—the visionary tour de force from “one of the grand masters of science fiction” (The Wall Street Journal). Widely acknowledged as one of Robert A. Heinlein's greatest works, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress rose from the golden age of science fiction to become an undisputed classic—and a touchstone for the philosophy of personal responsibility and political freedom. A revolution on a lunar penal colony—aided by a self-aware supercomputer—provides the framework for a story of a diverse group of men and women grappling with the ever-changing definitions of humanity, technology, and free will—themes that resonate just as strongly today as they did when the novel was first published. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress gives readers an extraordinary, thought-provoking glimpse into the mind of Robert A. Heinlein, who, even now, “shows us where the future is” (Tom Clancy).",['Robert A.

Scar Tissue,"In this ""vivid and inspiring"" NYT bestseller (Newsweek), the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lead singer and songwriter shares a searingly honest account of life in the rock scene's fast lane -- from the darkness into the light. In 1983, four self-described ""knuckleheads"" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. In Scar Tissue, Kiedis delivers a compelling life story from a man ""in love with everything"" -- the darkness, the death, the disease. Even his descent into drug addiction was a part of that journey, another element transformed into art. Whether he's honoring the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses or remembering the roaring crowds of Woodstock and the Dalai Lama's humble compound, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. Scar Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption -- a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.",['Anthony Kiedis' ' Larry Sloman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VUSZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VUSZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Scar+Tissue&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette Books,2004-10-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VUSZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Music'],319,4.294670846394984,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""Scar Tissue"":

The Sound and the Fury,"The Sound and the Fury is the tragedy of the Compson family, featuring some of the most memorable characters in literature: beautiful, rebellious Caddy; the manchild Benjy; haunted, neurotic Quentin; Jason, the brutal cynic; and Dilsey, their black servant. Their lives fragmented and harrowed by history and legacy, the character’s voices and actions mesh to create what is arguably Faulkner’s masterpiece and one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. “I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire. . . .

An ordinary person would cave under the pressure. But hey, she's from Jersey. Stephanie Plum may not be the best bounty hunter in beautiful downtown Trenton, but she's pretty darn good at turning bad situations her way . . . and she always gets her man. In To the Nines, her cousin Vinnie (who's also her boss) has posted bail on Samuel Singh, an illegal immigrant. When the elusive Mr. Singh goes missing, Stephanie is on the case. But what she uncovers is far more sinister than anyone imagines and leads to a group of killers who give new meaning to the word hunter. In a race against time that takes her from the Jersey Turnpike to the Vegas Strip, Stephanie Plum is on the chase of her life. The unforgettable characters, nonstop action, high-stakes suspense, and sheer entertainment of To the Nines define Janet Evanovich as unique among today's writers.",['Janet Evanovich'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jKx9fgGuPkcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jKx9fgGuPkcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+the+Nines&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2008-05-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jKx9fgGuPkcC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],294,4.41156462585034,"Here are the chosen tags for the book ""To the Nines"" by Janet Evanovich:

"The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality","From Brian Greene, one of the world’s leading physicists and author of the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Elegant Universe, comes a grand tour of the universe that makes us look at reality in a completely different way. Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive, mathematical concepts like String Theory, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies drawn from common experience. From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant objects can instantaneously coordinate their behavior, Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.",['Brian Greene'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fabric+of+the+Cosmos:+Space,+Time,+and+the+Texture+of+Reality&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Vintage,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DNd2K6mxLpIC&source=gbs_api,['Science'],273,4.531135531135531,"Here are the chosen tags:

Tea Rose,"The Tea Rose is a towering old-fashioned story, imbued with a modern sensibility, of a family's destruction, of murder and revenge, of love lost and won again, and of one determined woman's quest to survive and triumph. East London, 1888-a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, a bright and defiant young woman dares to dream of a life beyond tumbledown wharves, gaslit alleys, and the grim and crumbling dwellings of the poor. Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. But Fiona's dreams are shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death at the dark man's hands, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit-and the ghosts of her past-propel her rise from a modest west side shopfront to the top of Manhattan's tea trade. Authentic and moving, Jennifer Donnelly's The Tea Rose is an unforgettable novel.",['Jennifer Donnelly'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RnGiTylV3pMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RnGiTylV3pMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tea+Rose&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan,2007-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RnGiTylV3pMC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],281,4.437722419928826,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Tea Rose"":

Tourist, Rincewind decided, meant idiot.Somewhere on the frontier between thought and reality exists the Discworld, a parallel time and place which might sound and smell very much like our own, but which looks completely different. It plays by different rules. Certainly it refuses to succumb to the quaint notion that universes are ruled by pure logic and the harmony of numbers.But just because the Disc is different doesn't mean that some things don't stay the same. Its very existence is about to be threatened by a strange new blight: the arrival of the first tourist, upon whose survival rests the peace and prosperity of the land.

Howards End,"The Never-Ending Conflict Between the Old Ways and the New Ways “The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty.” - E.M. Forster, Howards End Howards End is an estate with a rich history and cultural heritage cherished by the Wilcoxes, a rich family with traditional ideas. However, the half-German Schlegeles – the new aristocracy – are not that impressed, yet Ruth Wilcox sees Margaret Schlegel as the ideal owner. That’s why on deathbed, Ruth leaves the house to Margaret in written note. The note is burnt by the husband Henry who grows fonder of Margaret with each passing day. Is Margaret bound to Howards End? And what does all of this have to do with the struggling Basts? Xist Publishing is a digital-first publisher.

"Leaves of grass,","Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",['Walt Whitman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-09,"http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Poetry'],276,4.27536231884058,"Here are the chosen tags:

Wuthering Heights.,"Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. HeathcliffÕs dwelling. ÔWutheringÕ being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date Ô1500,Õ and the name ÔHareton Earnshaw.Õ I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here Ôthe houseÕ pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",['Emily Bronte'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wuthering+Heights.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&source=gbs_api,None,868,4.096774193548387,"Here are the tags that fit best for the book ""Wuthering Heights"":

"1,000 Places to See Before You Die: A Traveler's Life List","The world’s bestselling travel book is back in a more informative, more experiential, more budget-friendly full-color edition. A #1 New York Times bestseller, 1,000 Places reinvented the idea of travel book as both wish list and practical guide. As Newsweek wrote, it “tells you what’s beautiful, what’s fun, and what’s just unforgettable— everywhere on earth.” And now the best is better. There are 600 full-color photographs. Over 200 entirely new entries, including visits to 28 countries like Lebanon, Croatia, Estonia, and Nicaragua, that were not in the original edition. There is an emphasis on experiences: an entry covers not just Positano or Ravello, but the full 30-mile stretch along the Amalfi Coast. Every entry from the original edition has been readdressed, rewritten, and made fuller, with more suggestions for places to stay, restaurants to visit, festivals to check out. And throughout, the book is more budget-conscious, starred restaurants and historic hotels such as the Ritz, but also moderately priced gems that don’t compromise on atmosphere or charm.

"Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles","An all-access, firsthand account of the life and music of one of history's most beloved bands--from an original mastering engineer at Abbey Road Geoff Emerick became an assistant engineer at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in 1962 at age fifteen, and was present as a new band called the Beatles recorded their first songs. He later worked with the Beatles as they recorded their singles “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” the songs that would propel them to international superstardom. In 1964 he would witness the transformation of this young and playful group from Liverpool into professional, polished musicians as they put to tape classic songs such as “Eight Days A Week” and “I Feel Fine.” Then, in 1966, at age nineteen, Geoff Emerick became the Beatles’ chief engineer, the man responsible for their distinctive sound as they recorded the classic album Revolver, in which they pioneered innovative recording techniques that changed the course of rock history. Emerick would also engineer the monumental Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road albums, considered by many the greatest rock recordings of all time. In Here, There and Everywhere he reveals the creative process of the band in the studio, and describes how he achieved the sounds on their most famous songs. Emerick also brings to light the personal dynamics of the band, from the relentless (and increasingly mean-spirited) competition between Lennon and McCartney to the infighting and frustration that eventually brought a bitter end to the greatest rock band the world has ever known.",['Geoff Emerick' ' Howard Massey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOk8TP8o018C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOk8TP8o018C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Here,+There+and+Everywhere:+My+Life+Recording+the+Music+of+the+Beatles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,2006-03-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WOk8TP8o018C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],264,4.4356060606060606,"Here are the chosen tags:

Dry: A Memoir,"The Tenth Anniversary Edition of the New York Times bestselling book that has sold over half a million copies in paperback. ""I was addicted to ""Bewitched"" as a kid. I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he'd come home from work and Samantha would say, ‘Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?' He'd always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, ‘Better make it a double.'"" (from Chapter Two) You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life—and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true. Dry is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a Higher Power.",['Augusten Burroughs'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qeKJh-bG3ysC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qeKJh-bG3ysC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dry:+A+Memoir&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Picador,2013-04-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qeKJh-bG3ysC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],313,4.514376996805112,"Here are the chosen tags:

Elantris,"In 2005, Brandon Sanderson debuted with Elantris, an epic fantasy unlike any other then on the market. To celebrate its tenth anniversary, Tor is reissuing Elantris in a special edition, a fresh chance to introduce it to the myriad readers who have since become Sanderson fans. This new edition begins with a preface by author Dan Wells, the first person to read the completed novel, and a new afterword by Sanderson explaining how he came to write the book and its place in the Cosmere, the unified universe of all his Tor novels. Also included is an expanded version of the ""Ars Arcanum"" appendix, with more of the technical details of the book's magic that fans can never get enough of. Elantris was truly a milestone both for Sanderson and for the genre of epic fantasy. It deserves this special treatment, something Tor has done only once before, with Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. Sanderson fans old and new will be excited to discover it.",['Brandon Sanderson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=73CcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=73CcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Elantris&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan,2015-10-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=73CcCgAAQBAJ&dq=Elantris&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],342,4.219298245614035,"Here are the chosen tags:

LAURA INGALLS WILDER'S LITTLE HOUSE BOOKS The Complete Set 9 Volumes,"The set includes: Little House in the Big Woods, Little House on the Prairie, Farmer Boy, On the Banks of Plum Creek, By the Shores of Silver Lake, The Long Winter, Little Town on the Prairie, These Happy Golden Years, and The First Four Years. Little House in the Big Woods Wolves and panthers and bears roam the deep Wisconsin woods in the late 1870's. In those same woods, Laura lives with Pa and Ma, and her sisters, Mary and Baby Carrie, in a snug little house built of logs. Pa hunts and traps. Ma makes her own cheese and butter. All night long, the wind howls lonesomely, but Pa plays the fiddle and sings, keeping the family safe and cozy. Little House on the Prairie Pa Ingalls decides to sell the little log house, and the family sets out for Indian country! They travel from Wisconsin to Kansas, and there, finally, Pa builds their little house on the prairie. Sometimes farm life is difficult, even dangerous, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie. Farmer Boy While Laura Ingalls grows up in a little house on the western prairie, Almanzo Wilder is living on a big farm in New York State. Almanzo and his brother and sisters work at their chores from dawn to supper most days -- no matter what the weather. There is still time for fun, though, especially with the horses, which Almanzo loves more than anything. On the Banks of Plum Creek Laura's family's first home in Minnesota is made of sod, but Pa builds a clean new house made of sawed lumber beside Plum Creek. The money for materials will come from their first wheat crop. Then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Soon millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm. In a week's time, there is no wheat crop left at all. By the Shores of Silver Lake Pa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. And Pa begins work on the first building in what will soon be a brand-new town on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long Winter The first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. Snow has reached the rooftops, and no trains can get through with food or coal. The people of De Smet are starving, including Laura's family, who wonder how they're going to make it through this terrible winter. It is young Almanzo Wilder who finally understands what needs to be done. He must save the town, even if it means risking his own life. Little Town on the Prairie The long winter is over. With spring come socials, parties, and ""Literaries."" There is also work to be done. Laura spends many hours each day sewing shirts to help send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder. These Happy Golden Years Laura is teaching school, and it's terrifying! Most of the students are taller than she is, and she must sleep away from home for the first time. Laura is miserable, but the money is needed to keep Mary in a college for the blind. And every Friday -- no matter what the weather -- Almanzo Wilder arrives to take Laura home to her family for the weekend. Laura and Almanzo are courting, and even though she's not yet sixteen, she knows that this is a time for new beginnings. The First Four Years Laura and Almanzo Wilder have just been married! Their life on a small prairie homestead begins with high hopes. But each year seems to bring unexpected disasters -- storms, sickness, fire, and unpaid debts. These first four years call for courage, strength, and a great deal of determination. Always, though, there is love, especially for the newest member of the family -- baby Rose.",['Laura Ingalls Wilder'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OwhdvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OwhdvgAACAAJ&dq=LAURA+INGALLS+WILDER%27S+LITTLE+HOUSE+BOOKS+The+Complete+Set+9+Volumes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,1994-01-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=OwhdvgAACAAJ&dq=LAURA+INGALLS+WILDER%27S+LITTLE+HOUSE+BOOKS+The+Complete+Set+9+Volumes&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Juvenile Fiction'],294,4.775510204081633,"Here are the chosen tags:
