Description: . Reviews: Truly  sad story. At first a bit graphic but ok after the first few chapters. Some is moving, some is laughable, life experiences. Young school boys sign up to WW1 They go away as boys and those that do return, as what? They become men at war but without the normal experiences of being a teenager. They have no job or wife to return to but are too old for school. A generation lost. A particularly sad part for me was the main character returning home for a visit. He was so happy to leave the trenches for a while and see his family but when he got there he couldn't fit in or share his experiences with those at home. The only life he knew as an adult was in the trenches. And so many died, the futility of it all. It's not all doom and gloom, I thought i wouldn't be able to handle it but it really was an excellent read. Overview<br />This book is a first-hand account of the life of Paul B\\u00e4umer, who belongs to a squad of German soldiers on the Western Front during World War I. Paul and his classmates enlisted in the army at the end of their high school career as a result of the impassioned patriotism and relentless coaxing of their teacher, Kantorek.<br /><br />All Quiet on the Western front tells the story of Paul and his friends experiences in the trenches. There is a lot of fighting, death, and destruction in this book, but there are also scenes of comradery, friendship, and bravery that break up the \\u2018heaviness\\u2019 of this read and give the reader some short periods of lighter relief.<br /><br />Among these lighter scenes is one when Paul and his friend \\u2018Kat\\u2019 decide to poach a goose from a local farm. They roast the bird and enjoy a midnight feast, even venturing to share some of their spoil with friends who are in prison for insubordination towards a senior officer.<br />There are also some interesting insights into life for the French civilians trying to survive amid the disruption and decimation of the war. Russian prisoners of war also feature in this story and their pitiful plight is almost too much to bear.<br />My thoughts<br />Why do young men volunteer for war?<br />I look at my two sons and I wonder why young men hurl themselves into the teeth of the storm through voluntary subscription to the army. I read about this in The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, and I read about it again in this great, but disturbing, novel, All Quiet on the Western Front.<br />I have decided there are a few reasons that lead to this rash action. The first, is the expectation of parents and other older members of society that their sons throw down the gauntlet and risk all for \\u201cking and country\\u201d. Secondly, I believe there has historically been a terrible ignorance about the reality of war. War is glamourized and young men enter the fray with no concept of its harsh conditions or the horror of death.<br />I wonder if the young men of today would be as eager to take up the role of \\u2018cannon fodder\\u2019 with their greater knowledge of the world through internet access and better educational opportunities.<br />Leaders and war mongers pray on the passionate fervor of the young to achieve their ill-gotten ends when it comes to war. Wars are all fought either for purposes of greed and power or over religion. More recently, greed and power have trumped the possibly purer intentions of religion. Have recently explored in great depth the reasons behind the Anglo Zulu War and both Anglo Boer Wars in South Africa, as well as the First and Second World War, power and the gain of wealth have been the overarching reasons for placing young men in the line of fire and, often, ending their lives before they have even started.<br />All Quite on the Western Front is a book that is written in a war setting and exposes with a sharp and unerringly accurate pen, the absolute horror of the First World War. The book is not, however, about the war, but rather about the loss of innocence the young soldiers experience and their inability to ever adapt back to civilian life afterwards. This is quite clear by the manner in which the story is told. Battles are not named and have so little relevance to the story that whether they are won or lost is not even revealed. Battles feature as a regular feature of the lives of Paul and his comrades; one during which death is a high possibility and survival is the only goal.<br />The obvious themes of war and patriotism that present in this novel are not the ones that resonated with me.<br />Given my status as the mother of two teenage boys, not much younger than the boys featured in this novel, it is understandable that the following themes are the ones that have stayed in my mind. I am sharing select quotes that explain these themes as they do so far better than I could.<br />Loss of innocence<br />\\u201cWhile they went on writing and making speeches, we saw field hospitals and men dying: while they preached the service of the state as the greatest thing, we already knew that the fear of death is even greater. This didn\\u2019t make us into rebels or deserters, or turn us into cowards \\u2013 and they were more than ready to use all of these words \\u2013 because we loved our country just as much as they did, and so we went bravely into every attack. But now we were able to distinguish things clearly, all at once our eyes had been opened. And we saw that there was nothing left of their world. Suddenly we found ourselves horrible alone \\u2013 and we had to come to terms with it alone as well.<br />Loss of individuality<br />\\u201cI can still remember how embarrassed we were at the beginning, when we were recruits in the barracks and had to use the communal latrines. There are no doors, so that twenty men had to sit side by side as if they were on a train. That way they could all be seen at a glance \\u2013 soldiers, of course, have to be under supervision at all times.<br />Since then we\\u2019ve learnt more than just how to cope with a bit of embarrassment. As time went by, our habits changed quite a bit.,<br />Out here in the open air the whole business is a real pleasure.\\u201d<br />Home<br />\\u201cIt gets dark. Kemmerich\\u2019s face gets paler, it stands out against his pillow and is so white that it looks luminous. He makes a small movement with his mouth. I get closer to him. He whispers, \\u2018If you find my watch, send it home.\\u2019<br />I don\\u2019t argue. There is no point any more. He is beyond convincing. I\\u2019m sick with helplessness. That forehead, sunk in at the temples, that mount, which is all teeth now, that thin, sharp nose. And the fat, tearful woman at home that I shall have to write to \\u2013 I wish I had that job behind me already.\\u201d<br />Hopelessness<br />\\u201cBut our mates are dead, and we can\\u2019t help them. They are at peace \\u2013 who knows what we might still have to face? We want to chuck ourselves down and sleep, or stuff as much food into our bellies as we can, and booze and smoke, so that the passing hours aren\\u2019t so empty. Life is short.\\u201d<br />Primitiveness<br />\\u201cIt\\u2019s a nuisance trying to kill every single louse when you\\u2019ve got hundreds of them. The beasts are hard, and it gets to be a bore when you are forever pinching them between your nails. So Tjaden has rigged up a boot-polish lid hanging on a piece of wire over a burning candle-end. You just have toss the lice into this little frying-pan \\u2013 there is a sharp crack, and that\\u2019s it.\\u201d<br />Conclusion<br />All Quiet on the Western Front is a book we should never forget and which must never be removed from its place as a historical classic. Its primary role in literature, in my opinion, is that it illustrates the pointlessness of war which descends into a series of actions and day-to-day survival with no real meaning or even importance to those involved in the fighting. This sentiment is generally presented through the character of Albert Kropp, one of Paul\\u2019s previous school friends.<br />This book also highlights the destruction of young men\\u2019s innocence and their inability to ever reconnect with ordinary civilian life. It doesn\\u2019t mention post-traumatic stress syndrome specifically, but this is alluded to throughout the book.<br /><br />All in, this is one of the most emotional and memorable books I have ever read.\",\n          \"All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel.

Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. Excerpt. \\u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone \\u00a0 For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it \\u2013 none more prominently than Churchill\\u2019s great classic, The\\u00a0World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a\\u00a0million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed \\u2013 in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington\\u2019s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves\\u2019s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack \\u2018the system\\u2019, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below\\u00a0story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine\\u2019s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man\\u2019s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest \\u2013 Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick\\u2019s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque\\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship \\u00a0of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag \\u2018War Guilt\\u2019 committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the \\u2018good German\\u2019 Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report. \\u00a0 This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, \\u2018reparations\\u2019, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque. \\u00a0 For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in\\u00a01915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking\\u00a0on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well \\u2013 understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers\\u2019 Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers\\u2019 Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a \\u2018stab in the back\\u2019. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis\\u2019 burned books. \\u00a0 Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools.\\u00a0When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive \\u2013 we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared \\u2013 was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men\\u2019s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet . \\u00a0 There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque\\u2019s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed \\u2013 the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 \\u2013 five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque\\u2019s boys are knocked out by\\u00a0shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks\\u2019s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia \\u2013 infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque\\u2019s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also\\u00a0been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became \\u2018the Hun\\u2019 in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe \\u2013 \\u2018petition of the intellectuals\\u2019 \\u2013 associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist\\u00a0nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened\\u00a0with Paul Baumer\\u2019s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did \\u2013 those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man\\u2019s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn\\u2019t see and was mad with pain he didn\\u2019t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.\\u2019 (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch\\u2019s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God \\u2013 and clergymen \\u2013 are missing from Remarque\\u2019s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman\\u2019s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers\\u2019 deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier\\u00a0stumbles in. Baumer\\u2019s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man\\u2019s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque\\u2019s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight\\u2019s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: \\u2018aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden\\u2019 \\u2013 as if the Flanders front could easily be \\u2018broken through and then rolled up\\u2019. \\u00a0 The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque \\u2013 originally \\u2018Remark\\u2019 (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) \\u2013 had in reverse been \\u2018Kramer\\u2019, a Jewish name meaning \\u2018pedlar\\u2019. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler\\u2019s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters \\u2013 what other men called an Etappenschwein (\\u2018rear-area pig\\u2019). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, \\u2018demoralizing the armed forces\\u2019) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. Read more. Reviews: What a great work of fiction.  Feeling ashamed that I had never read this novel but heard so much about it, I finally got a copy and burned through the pages in 3 days.  It certainly lived up to its name and legacy.  The writing is to the point, Hemingway-esque, and rarely slows.  Every fifth paragraph leaves one a jewel phrase or entire sentence that can qualify as a memorable quote.  For example:  &#34;What do they expect of us if a time ever comes when this war is over?  Through the years our business has been killing;--it was our first calling in life.  Our knowledge of life is limited to death.  What will happen afterwards?  And what shall come of us?&#34;<br /><br />In my opinion, the Nazis burned Remarque's books not because he changed his name to a non-German name, but because this book is filled with anti-war sentiment cloaked as it had to be in 1928 when this was first published.  To have lived through war in the trenches as Remarque did, qualifies him to speak to the insanity of mass killing that is war.<br /><br />Let us all read his pages and imbibe the message of the cruelty and senselessness of war.  I feel as if I want to go out and obtain a copy of every book Remarque ever published.  Let his experience be our teacher; let his message endure.  Let every school-kid in the world read and study these pages, so they come to know what war is.  Let the decision-makers of the world pore over every passage, and ask themselves whether they will send their children to war.  Let Remarque's works guide their decision.<br /><br />Truly a classic.\",\n          \"All Quiet on the Western Front. Description: Review \\u201cThe world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque.

War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed \\u2013 in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington\\u2019s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves\\u2019s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack \\u2018the system\\u2019, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below\\u00a0story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine\\u2019s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man\\u2019s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest \\u2013 Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick\\u2019s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque\\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship \\u00a0of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag \\u2018War Guilt\\u2019 committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the \\u2018good German\\u2019 Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report. \\u00a0 This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, \\u2018reparations\\u2019, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque. \\u00a0 For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in\\u00a01915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking\\u00a0on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well \\u2013 understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers\\u2019 Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers\\u2019 Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a \\u2018stab in the back\\u2019. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis\\u2019 burned books. \\u00a0 Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools.\\u00a0When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive \\u2013 we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared \\u2013 was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men\\u2019s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet . \\u00a0 There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque\\u2019s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed \\u2013 the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 \\u2013 five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque\\u2019s boys are knocked out by\\u00a0shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks\\u2019s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia \\u2013 infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque\\u2019s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also\\u00a0been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became \\u2018the Hun\\u2019 in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe \\u2013 \\u2018petition of the intellectuals\\u2019 \\u2013 associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist\\u00a0nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened\\u00a0with Paul Baumer\\u2019s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did \\u2013 those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man\\u2019s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn\\u2019t see and was mad with pain he didn\\u2019t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.\\u2019 (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch\\u2019s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God \\u2013 and clergymen \\u2013 are missing from Remarque\\u2019s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman\\u2019s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers\\u2019 deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier\\u00a0stumbles in. Baumer\\u2019s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man\\u2019s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque\\u2019s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight\\u2019s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: \\u2018aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden\\u2019 \\u2013 as if the Flanders front could easily be \\u2018broken through and then rolled up\\u2019. \\u00a0 The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque \\u2013 originally \\u2018Remark\\u2019 (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) \\u2013 had in reverse been \\u2018Kramer\\u2019, a Jewish name meaning \\u2018pedlar\\u2019. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler\\u2019s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters \\u2013 what other men called an Etappenschwein (\\u2018rear-area pig\\u2019). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, \\u2018demoralizing the armed forces\\u2019) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. Read more. Reviews: This book is labeled as a novel but is actually the reflections of the author\\u2019s experience during the years as a young volunteer in the German Army during the First World War.  The author is represented by the central fictional character, Paul Baumer.  The book begins with Paul comforting a young boyhood friend and classmate, Franz Kemmerisch, who was a fellow young volunteer suffering from a combat wound and dying in a field hospital.  Toward the end of the book,  another combat death occurred, this time an older soldier and the author\\u2019s mentor, Stanislaus \\\"Kat\\\" Katczinsky.  In between, there was the scene of hand-to-hand combat, during which Paul killed a French soldier in a trench.  For several hours, he watched the man die, slowly and painfully. He felt remorse and asked forgiveness from the man's corpse. He was emotionally devastated.  When he rejoined his comrades, they tried to comfort him and reassured him that it was only part of the war.<br /><br />There were descriptions of horrific combat wounds:<br /><br />\\u201cWe see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run with their two feet cut off; we see men without mouths, without jaws, without faces\\u2026..\\u201d<br /><br />Then there was the narrative when the author and several of his comrades were wounded and taken to an army hospital.  The surgeon-general of the hospital was keen on amputations, regardless of whether the procedure was necessary.  On frequent occasions, patients in serious conditions were taken to the \\u201cdying room\\u201d.  Returning from the dying room was extremely rare.  Fortunately, it did occur to one of Paul\\u2019s comrades.<br /><br />Out of such experiences, the author offered many memorable utterances and reflections:<br /><br />\\u25cf \\u201cWe reach the zone where the front begins and become on the instant human animals.\\u201d<br />\\u25cf \\u201cWe were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world, and we had to shoot it to pieces.\\u201d<br />\\u25cf \\u201cTerror can be endured so long as a man simply ducts \\u2013 but it kills, if a man thinks about it.\\u201d<br />\\u25cf \\u201cEvery full-grown emperor requires at least one war, otherwise he would not become famous\\u2026\\u2026And generals too, they become even more famous than emperors.\\u201d<br /><br />A most thoughtful and sensible proposal was made by Paul\\u2019s friend Albert Knopp.  \\u201cHe proposes that a declaration of war should be a kind of popular festival with entrance-tickets and bands, like a bull fight.  Then in the arena the ministers and generals of the two countries, dressed in bathing-drawers and armed with clubs, can have it out among themselves.  Whoever survives, his country wins.  That would be much simpler and more just than the present arrangement, where the wrong people do the fighting.\\u201d<br /><br />ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is considered by many the greatest war novel of all time.  Be that as it may, it is doubtful that the author\\u2019s wisdom, gained through painful personal experience and enunciated poignantly in the book, has made any significant impact in reducing the number of wars among nations, which are led by humans who, according to Mark Twain, \\u201c\\u2026was made at the end of the week\\u2019s work, when God was tired\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry\\u2019s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children\\u2019s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children\\u2019s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn\\u2019t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I\\u2019ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I\\u2019m very disappointed because this is the first time I\\u2019m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\",\n          \"Dune.

Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs\\u2014including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers\\u2014before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with \\u201cLooking for Something?\\u201d in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call \\u201cone of the monuments of modern science fiction.\\u201d Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. \\u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. \\u2014 from \\\"Manual of Muad'Dib\\\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow\\u2014hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \\\"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\\\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \\\"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\\\" \\\"So I've heard, so I've heard,\\\" wheezed the old woman. \\\"Yet he's already fifteen.\\\" \\\"Yes, Your Reverence.\\\" \\\"He's awake and listening to us,\\\" said the old woman. \\\"Sly little rascal.\\\" She chuckled. \\\"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\\\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals\\u2014the eyes of the old woman\\u2014seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \\\"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\\\" said the old woman. \\\"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\\\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was\\u2014a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis\\u2014Dune\\u2014Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete\\u2014an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \\\"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\\\" Hawat had said. Arrakis\\u2014Dune\\u2014Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound\\u2014the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed\\u2014thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis\\u2014Dune\\u2014Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \\\"You're awake,\\\" she said. \\\"Did you sleep well?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way\\u2014in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \\\"Hurry and dress,\\\" she said. \\\"Reverend Mother is waiting.\\\" \\\"I dreamed of her once,\\\" Paul said. \\\"Who is she?\\\" \\\"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\\\" She hesitated. \\\"You must tell her about your dreams.\\\" \\\"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\\\" \\\"We did not get Arrakis.\\\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \\\"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\\\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \\\"What's a gom jabbar?\\\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \\\"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\\\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \\\"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\\\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \\\"he is the one.\\\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\",\n          \"Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5).

I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG\\u2019s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

            "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Description: Amazon.com Review Join Douglas Adams's hapless hero Arthur Dent as he travels the galaxy with his intrepid pal Ford Prefect, getting into horrible messes and generally wreaking hilarious havoc. Dent is grabbed from Earth moments before a cosmic construction team obliterates the planet to build a freeway. You'll never read funnier science fiction; Adams is a master of intelligent satire, barbed wit, and comedic dialogue. The Hitchhiker's Guide is rich in comedic detail and thought-provoking situations and stands up to multiple reads. Required reading for science fiction fans, this book (and its follow-ups) is also sure to please fans of Monty Python, Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, and British sitcoms. Review “Lively, sharply satirical, brilliantly written . . . ranks with the best set pieces in Mark Twain.” — The Atlantic “Irresistible!” — The Boston Globe “With droll wit, a keen eye for detail and heavy doses of insight . . . Adams makes us laugh until we cry.” — The San Diego Union-Tribune “One of the greatest achievements in comedy. A work of staggering genius.” —David Walliams “Really entertaining and fun.” —Michael Palin “Fizzing with ideas . . . brilliant.” —Charlie Brooker “Weird and wonderful.” —Eoin Colfer “It changed my whole life.

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"

            "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, Book 7): Volume 7. Description: About the Author J.K. ROWLING is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter seven-book series, which have sold over 600 million copies in 85 languages, been listened to as audiobooks for over one billion hours and made into eight smash hit movies. To accompany the series, she wrote three short companion volumes for charity, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , which went on to inspire a new series of films featuring Magizoologist Newt Scamander. Harry’s story as a grown-up was continued in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , which J.K. Rowling wrote with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. In 2020, she returned to publishing for younger children with the fairy tale The Ickabog , the royalties for which she donated to her charitable trust, Volant, to help charities working to alleviate the social effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. Her latest children’s novel, The Christmas Pig , was published in 2021. J.K. Rowling has received many awards and honours for her writing, including for her detective series written under the name Robert Galbraith. She supports a wide number of humanitarian causes through Volant, and is the founder of the international children’s care reform charity Lumos. J.K. Rowling lives in Scotland with her family.. Reviews: I ordered this book for my daughter and she couldn’t put it down but at page 573, it jumped to 620.  I’ve missed the return window.  Just make sure to check the pages as soon as you receive the book. The book started out good but discovered as I was reading it that it's missing almost 50 pages in the middle of the book. Disappointing and frusterating The book has a printing error where pages are missing and in the wrong order. At page 620, the next page is number 573. I've included images of the book where the error is. If you turn pages ahead, the pages repeat pages 573-620 again and then rejoin the proper page chronology at page 669. Also, pages 621-668 are completely missing so I can't even read them in a different section and finish the story. :/ My ten year old daughter read the entire series within a few months. One of the books is almost 900 pages and she read it in 2 weeks! Finding 1 book that keeps your child intrigued and helps him or her develop a love for reading is amazing. J.K. Rowling gave my daughter 7! And now she's reading Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />Now I've been reading the books she's finished and her younger siblings are eager to read them as well. I bought this book and The Half Blood Prince brand new. I received old, used, and very damaged books. I immediately contacted the seller and explained the books were very damaged, and I was sent two new books. The Half Blood Prince was fine, however the Deathly Hallows was very bent. I’m very disappointed because this is the first time I’m reading the series and I wanted aesthetically pleasing books for the collection. The story is absolutely amazing and I look forward to reading it, but still, the damage to the books make it look very unappealing.\n"

            "Dune. Description: Review Praise for Dune “I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings .”—Arthur C. Clarke“It is possible that Dune is even more relevant now than when it was first published.”— The New Yorker “An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”— The Washington Post “One of the monuments of modern science fiction.”— Chicago Tribune “Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”—Robert A. Heinlein   “Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”— Louisville Times From the Back Cover Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. About the Author Frank Herbert is the bestselling author of the Dune saga. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs—including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers—before becoming a full-time writer.In 1952, Herbert began publishing science fiction with “Looking for Something?” in Startling Stories . But his emergence as a writer of major stature did not occur until 1965, with the publication of Dune . Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse: Dune followed, completing the saga that the Chicago Tribune would call “one of the monuments of modern science fiction.” Herbert is also the author of some twenty other books, including The White Plague , The Dosadi Experiment , and Destination: Void . He died in 1986. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter One A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place. — from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul. It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow—hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels. \"Is he not small forhis age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset. Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \"So I've heard, so I've heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he's already fifteen.\" \"Yes, Your Reverence.\" \"He's awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach ... well....\" Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his. \"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\" And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump. Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar? In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. Your Reverence. And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir. Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered. He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar ... Kwisatz Haderach . There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet . Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete—an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad. \"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. The dream faded. Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed—thinking ... thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet. Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness ... focusing the consciousness ... aortal dilation ... avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness ... to be conscious by choice ... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions ... one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone ... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct ... the animal destroys and does not produce ... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual ... the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe ... focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid ... bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs ... all things/cells/beings are impermanent ... strive for flow-permanence within.... Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled. When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling. The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. \"You're awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Yes.\" He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket. \"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\" \"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\" \"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul....\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\" \"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\" \"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\" Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What's a gom jabbar?\" Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear. Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \"You'll learn about ... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said. He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it. Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\" Read more. Reviews: Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \"he is the one.\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani Why in the world anyone would want to watch a movie made from this book is beyond my comprehension.  The characters are completely flat.  And the plot is about as played out as can be imagined.  Oh, you mean The One gains special powers and leads the tribe to new heights by the end?  His Uncle tries to kill him at the beginning? That he is cast out and wanders the desert seeking a Higher Power?  Gee where have I heard that one before? This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I'm about 150 pages in and I've found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />As for the story, it's very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.\n"

Not a remarkable house by any means—it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too—most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent’s house for what was to be the last time. It hadn’t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o’clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn’t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush—so. Scrub. Shaving mirror—pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent’s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it.'Yellow,' he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. “Yellow,” he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He’d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people’s faces. Something about a new bypass he’d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he’ d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn’t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. 'Yellow,' he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent’s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. “Come off it, Mr. Dent,” he said, “you can’t win, you know. You can’t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.” He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn’t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. “I’m game,” he said, “we’ll see who rusts first.” “I’m afraid you’re going to have to accept it,” said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be built!” “First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it got to be built?” Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. “What do you mean, why’s it got to be built?” he said. “It’s a bypass. You’ve got to build bypasses.” Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what’s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what’s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn’t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn’t know why—he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn’t him. Mr. Prosser said, “You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.” “Appropriate time?” hooted Arthur. “Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he’d come to clean the windows and he said no, he’d come to demolish the house. He didn’t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.” “But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.” “Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.” “But the plans were on display . . .” “On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.” “That’s the display department.” “With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘ Beware of the Leopard. ’” A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. “It’s not as if it’ s a particularly nice house,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I happen to like it.” “You’ ll like the bypass.” “Oh, shut up,” said Arthur Dent. “Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven’t got a leg to stand on and you know it.” Mr. Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’ s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. “Mr. Dent,” he said. “Hello? Yes?” said Arthur. “Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?” Read more. Reviews: I remember listening to sporadic episodes of the National Public Radio series of &#34;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; on my car radio on Saturday mornings in the 1980's.  It seemed quirky but mildly interesting at the time, although I didn't hear the early segments of the story and couldn't really follow what was going on.  I always intended to read the book someday to discover whether I might be missing something worthwhile--especially since so many friends and acquaintances had recommended the book highly over the years.<br /><br />I finally got my opportunity this month when a book club that I belong to chose it as its current selection.  I read the original book (there are many sequels) and was deeply disappointed.  The humor that I was expecting was simply not there--at least not in a way that I could appreciate it.  Believe me, I know about and adore surreal and absurd humor.  I love Monty Python skits and movies, and I have loved such television shows as The Addams Family and Get Smart.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is missing in this story.  Somehow Adams' attempts seem too self-conscious and self-aware.  If he were reciting the story aloud rather than writing it, I would expect him to pause regularly so that he could listen for reassuring guffaws before continuing.  In addition, the story was pointless--just a rambling with no unfolding and cohesive plot.  (Yes, I know about &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; styles.  The paucity of sophistication in &#34;Hitchhiker's&#34; renders it unworthy of that description.)<br /><br />For those who do like this book, I wish you well, but it did nothing for me.  I will be moving on.<br /><br />-- Jack Dostal Fast shipping and we got it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. great product - great transaction!\n"

            "All Quiet on the Western Front: A Novel. Description: Review “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”— The New York Times Book Review About the Author Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction by Norman Stone   For some years after the end of the First World War the memoirs of generals and statesmen dominated publication about it – none more prominently than Churchill’s great classic, The World Crisis (1923). Then, quite suddenly, ten years down the line, came the other side, the horror, the view from below. The British had lost almost a million men dead, the French over a million, and the Germans nearly two, mainly on the Western Front, where thousands of guns churned up the mud. War cripples hobbled the streets of Berlin, and are recorded in the bitter Twenties paintings of Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. Writers followed – in Great Britain, amongst the earliest books were Richard Aldington’s novel Death of a Hero (1929) and Robert Graves’s memoir Goodbye to All That (1929), the most famous of them all. I was given it as a Christmas present when I was fifteen and read it at a session. At the time, the mid- Fifties, there were men around, not even sixty, who had gone through the Western Front but you could never get them to talk about it. British critics did not attack ‘the system’, they tended to dwell on the incompetence of the generals. The French had a rather similar experience, in that the from-below story of 1914-18 surfaced with Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit (1932), which is brilliant black farce. Celine, who had volunteered in 1912, entered the War with the usual young man’s patriotism, and was badly maimed at an early stage; and he made a mockery of the whole business. But there is not really any French, let alone British or American, equivalent of the bitterness and edge that went into the paintings of Dix and Grosz. Two films come the closest – Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) which started off as a musical (1963) by Joan Littlewood based on the songs of the poor bloody infantry, and Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory (1957). On the literary side, the German Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is in a class of its own. It appeared not long before the Wall Street Crash started a process that was soon to give Germany eight million unemployed, and the Chancellorship  of Adolf Hitler. Not just the Nazis banned it; so did the Lord Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, a Centre Party Catholic and later first Chancellor of West Germany. Official Germany would not accept any responsibility for the War. In 1923 the legal scholar Hermann Kantorowicz put in a memorandum to the Reichstag ‘War Guilt’ committee, showing that three quarters of the published documents from 1914 were false, and even the ‘good German’ Gustav Stresemann tried to stop him from getting a Chair, and suppressed the report.   This is all understandable, because Germany did face a war indemnity, ‘reparations’, designed to cripple her for two generations, and to suggest that she had caused the War counted as treachery. But so did criticism of the army (and the fourteen-volume official history, besides being incomplete, was almost free of it). Exposing the reality was left to a writer such as Remarque.   For Germans the War had ended in defeat and disillusion. It had been a four-year epic of sacrifice, and there had been spectacular successes, from the capture of Russian Poland in 1915 through Caporetto in 1917, when the Italian front imploded, to the March Offensive of 1918, which destroyed the British Fifth Army. German generals had a panache lacking on the Allied side, almost to the end, and it is notable in All Quiet on the Western Front that there is very little criticism or mockery of generals, let alone officers, who come off well – understanding and humane. The Germans shot far fewer of their own men than did the British. When the armistice happened, attempts were made to imitate the Russian Revolution in which Soldiers’ Councils had challenged the authority of their officers. Far from being revolutionary, the German Soldiers’ Councils voted for Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg to be their overall president (he declined). Even so, some 25,000 German prisoners of war did join the Red Army. The end of the War saw bitter political recriminations: the Left blamed the Right for starting it, and the Right blamed the Left for stopping it, for giving the fighting troops a ‘stab in the back’. This civil war was always latent in the Weimar Republic, and it flared up again when the Wall Street Crash ended properly democratic government (in 1930: thereafter governments ruled by emergency decree). The civil war culminated in the victory, in 1933, of the Nazis. It also resulted in the emigration of Erich Maria Remarque. All Quiet was one of the Nazis’ burned books.   Remarque was not a Communist or even, it seems, anything much. He was born (1898) into a skilled working-class family in Osnabruck, his father a printer, and attended Catholic schools. When he turned eighteen, in 1916, he was conscripted, and after some basic training ( All Quiet is biting about that; the sadistic Corporal Himmelstoss is an archetype of military memoirs, where bright young men encounter maniacal and petty disciplinarians) he was drafted to Flanders. The British Offensive – we know it as Passchendaele, from the village the capture of which, after 400,000 casualties, allowed victory to be absurdly declared – was about to start, and Remarque was badly wounded on its first day, 31 July 1917, spending much of the rest of the War in hospital. He kept a notebook and recorded the men’s stories as he heard them. They form the basis for All Quiet .   There were two (at least) unique features of the Great War. For civilian conscripts, there was vast disillusion with everything that they had been taught by Authority; and then there was the sheer anonymity of the killing. Of Remarque’s class of twenty schoolboys in All Quiet , at least half get killed – the narrator, Paul Baumer, just a week or two before the armistice of November 1918 – five or more are wounded, and one ends up in a lunatic asylum. They are all caught up in the tremendous Materialschlachten , the industrial slaughter, that killed over nine million soldiers and maimed many, many more. This was an artillery war, and the guns multiplied in number, power and range; huge technical skill was involved (for instance, plotting by sound-range where, on a grid-map, an enemy gun was sited). Time and again, Remarque’s boys are knocked out by shelling. The ordeal involved is well-expounded in the last scene of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong (1993) where the hero digs himself out of a great mound of mud and corpses, such as these heavy shells threw up. They, rather than the legendary machine-guns, caused three-quarters of the casualties. It is extraordinary that the generals started out with an assumption that this would be a war rather like that of 1870-71, between France and Prussia – infantry charging in clumps, bayonets outstretched, cavalry sweeping forward, and fortresses holding out bravely under siege; and of course there was the widespread illusion that the war would be short, an illusion spread as much by bankers and economists as by generals. But artillery could smash even the stoutest fortress, cavalry were helpless targets for modern rifles, and the French learned in August 1914 just how vulnerable their charging infantry clumps were to shrapnel. Remarque’s schoolboys were confronted almost at once with a war that they had not imagined. And they had also been let down by men in authority. When the war broke out, Germany was vilified for the invasion of neutral Belgium (Germans became ‘the Hun’ in the British press) and over 1,300 of the most prominent academics signed a pompous Intellektuelleneingabe – ‘petition of the intellectuals’ – associating the great names of German civilization with tub-thumping nationalist nonsense, instead of appreciating that the War was a sort of suicide. On a less exalted level, schoolteachers, the pride of Prussia, shovelled their sixth forms into uniform, as happened with Paul Baumer’s class. Once they were at the front, what were they to make of these maniacal schoolteachers who had filled their heads with such useless nonsense as French irregular verbs and the population of Melbourne? In All Quiet the hero wonders whether they ever could get back to normal, after the war, but they did – those who survived. Remarque himself knocked around for a few years, which included primary school teaching (often an essential booster-stage for something else), then, aged twenty-two, published a vaguely radical-right novel he soon wished he had not written, and drifted into sports journalism for a large media concern. Then, at thirty, he produced the work for which he is remembered. All Quiet on the Western Front became an international bestseller, and was snapped up by Hollywood for a record sum. Not surprisingly, like the early works of Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, who also thought cinematically, it made an excellent film. Early in the novel, Paul recalls the population-of-Melbourne maniac getting his seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds as a class to march down the street and volunteer in 1914. One of them, Josef Behm, under-age and overweight, does not want to go, attack, and we left him for dead . . . That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him.’ (This colloquially rendered passage is characteristic of Professor Brian Murdoch’s excellently readable translation.) The War, which had started with cavalry and charging infantry, turned into a long artillery epic, and there are some splendid descriptions of bombardment (Allan Mallinson recalls that no man is an atheist under bombardment, but God – and clergymen – are missing from Remarque’s pages). One after another, the boys go. Second is Kemmerich, at first unaware, in hospital, that his leg has been amputated; there is some awkwardness among his visitors as to whether they should just take his special English airman’s soft-leather boots; Muller wants them, saying his own boots are so bad that even his blisters get blisters. The soldiers’ deaths are recorded intermittently, interspersed with bitter comments and dramatically described events of trench warfare. A failed French attack gives rise to the most memorable scene in the film, which sticks in my mind sixty years after seeing it. Baumer, on forward observation, takes shelter in a shell hole, and a French soldier stumbles in. Baumer’s instinctive reaction is to stab him, and the Frenchman takes hours to die, the German dressing his wounds, giving him water and talking to him even after he is finally dead. He looks into the man’s wallet to identify him, and finds letters from his wife, photographs of his children in a village somewhere. There are other scenes of fraternization, but they are with French girls. Remarque’s general idea is that it is all hellish and that the only sort of meaning to be found is in the cameraderie involved, as Paul and his friends find ways of dealing with rats or with the lack of decent food, or take revenge on the sadistic training corporal whom they encounter again at the front. The description of a fortnight’s home leave is particularly harrowing, as Baumer finds he has nothing to say to his father. And there are still old saloon-bar wiseacres, showering him with cigars, who tell him how the War should be won: ‘aber vor allem muss die gegnerische Front in Flandern durchbrochen und dann von oben aufgerollt werden’ – as if the Flanders front could easily be ‘broken through and then rolled up’.   The wiseacres hated the book, seeing it as an insult to the German army, and the Nazis put it about that Remarque – originally ‘Remark’ (he gave it a French twist: his forebears had been Remarques from across the border) – had in reverse been ‘Kramer’, a Jewish name meaning ‘pedlar’. They also made much of the fact that Remarque had not served in the front line. The irony was that Hitler himself, though he had two medals, did not really have a heroic war. We know from some extraordinary research by Thomas Weber ( Hitler’s First War , 2010) that he was not a front-line soldier but a messenger who spent most of his time at headquarters – what other men called an Etappenschwein (‘rear-area pig’). In the British army it was called having a cushy job. Regimental colonels were sent bags of medals from time to time, for distribution, and Hitler got two of them because he was conveniently there, according to his own account, reading Schopenhauer from a pocketbook. Half of the veterans from his regiment, Bavarian Catholics, refused to turn up when called upon to attend a reunion in 1934 to celebrate the victory of their alleged fellow-soldier, now Fuhrer. Remarque had already left Germany the day after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. He had easily enough money from royalties to live in Switzerland, and later in Hollywood and New York. He never lived in Germany again. The Nazis, in time, chased his poor sister, Elfriede Scholz, a dressmaker in Dresden. She was denounced by her landlady and a customer in 1943 for saying the war was lost, as indeed it was. An example was made of her, for Wehrkraftzersetzung (roughly, ‘demoralizing the armed forces’) and she was beheaded. After World War II Remarque remained in the USA, quite successful, though always best-known for All Quiet . In the 1950s he married the American actress Paulette Goddard, moved back to Switzerland, and died there in 1970. But All Quiet lives on, and deserves to. --This text refers to an alternate kindle_edition edition.

Reviews: There are books you read in your youth deemed classics that one is unable to fully appreciate until you've grown up, gained a greater appreciation of both life and the context that produced such works.  Without a doubt, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Fronts&#34; is one of those novels.  I read &#34;AQOTWF&#34; in 8th grade and remember liking the book.  I generally do not re-read books, but after listening to podcasts and reading history on WWI recently, I wanted to go back and experience this book with better context.<br /><br />Remarque served in the German army during WWI and is able to elicit the type of imagery and feeling only someone as a witness and participant can conjure.  The story is narrated by Paul Baumer, an 18 year old German, who enlists along with many of his other school mates.  WWI marked a turning point, the advent of modern warfare driven by technological change, couple with armies comprised of general citizens and less of hired or mercenary fighting forces.  Paul and his school mates immediately encounter this horror, different from the romanticized battles of yore that they learn about in school.  Remarque doesn't choose to place the characters in specific battles, representing the reality of a large portion of the war on the Western Front.  These battles were brutality and killing like the world had never seen, the bulk of it trench warfare, with sides progressed marked not by victory or defeat, but yards or feet advanced.  Death is everywhere, soldiers fighting in trenches alongside dead bodies of their colleagues and human waste for days, sometimes weeks at a time.  All of this is remarkably rendered throughout &#34;AQOTWF&#34; along with Paul's transformation from naive & willing enlistee to disillusioned and devastated participant.<br /><br />It is not just the physical that Remarque captures so poetically, but the emotional trauma.  Some of the most poignant scenes take place off the battlefield.  Paul's leave where he returns to his village is my favorite part of the book.  We see the demons of a returning soldier, too traumatized to share the reality of the front lines with his family while they realize the different person he's become as a result of war.  Essentially, Paul's soul is lost in spite of his physical body being unaffected.  They termed it &#34;shellshock&#34; at the time, something we now refer to as PTSD.  There are so many gut wrenching scenes of Paul and his friends confronting the reality of war, death and destruction at a point in life when they should be thinking about their future.<br /><br />If you haven't read &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front&#34;, it certainly should merit your attention.  Like me, if you've read it as a teen, it is worth revisiting as its impact with greater context and a life lived will make you appreciate this novel even more.\n"

            "A Dance With Dragons: Part 2 After The Feast: The bestselling classic epic fantasy series behind the award-winning HBO and Sky TV show and phenomenon GAME OF THRONES (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5). Description: About the Author George R.R. Martin is the author of fourteen novels, including five volumes of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, several collections of short stories and numerous screen plays for television drama and feature films. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. Review `Colossal, staggering... Martin captures all the intoxicating complexity of the Wars of the Roses or Imperial Rome in his imaginary world ... one of the greats of fantasy literature'SFX`This is one of those rare and effortless reads' ROBIN HOBB`George R.R. Martin is one of our very best writers, and this is one of his very best books' RAYMOND E. FEIST`Such a splendid tale. I read my eyes out - I couldn't stop till I'd finished and it was dawn' ANNE MCCAFFREY`George Martin is assuredly a new master craftsman in the guild of heroic fantasy' KATHARINE KERR`Few created worlds are as imaginative and diverse' JANNY WURTS --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.. Reviews: Fans, beware. This is not new material. It's already part of the Kindle version of A Dance With Dragons. I really don't know why they had to split up the book now. I am gutted - thought this was an extra volume to the Dance of Dragons based on the title and description but it isn't! A waste of money as the chapters in here were already in Dance of Dragons. Very misleading and I am trying to find out if I can get a refund! I started reading this series of which this is the fifth after seeing the TV series.  They as far as they go are very good.  What has got my goat is the fact that at the end of book 5 and there is still no end in sight.  Half the characters that I liked have disappeared others are dead and although some of the bad guys are dead there are still way too many of them still out there.  Now I have to wait for George to write the next book!!!!\n"

            "Baptism of Fire (The Witcher, 5). Description: Review \"This is a series you can sink your teeth into.\"― BuzzFeed News \"Delightful, intense, irreverent, and compelling....you have to read The Witcher books because they are rife with all of the elements that make you love fiction, and especially fantasy, in the first place....In a word, The Witcher delivers.\"― Hypable \"One of the best and most interesting fantasy series I've ever read.\"― Nerds of a Feather \"Like Mieville and Gaiman, [Sapkowski] takes the old and makes it new ... fresh take on genre fantasy.\"― Foundation \"Sapkowski has a confident and rich voice which permeates the prose and remains post-translation. I'd recommend this to any fan of heroic or dark fiction.\"― SF Book Reviews About the Author Andrzej Sapkowski is the author of the Witcher series and the Hussite Trilogy. He was born in 1948 in Poland and studied economics and business, but the success of his fantasy cycle about Geralt of Rivia turned him into an international bestselling writer. Geralt’s story has inspired the hit Netflix show and multiple video games, has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and has sold millions of copies worldwide.. Reviews: I absolutely love whole series of The Witcher. Very interesting plot, full of surprises, Geralt is the best. You have to read it. I suggest to read it in order to be able to understand everything!<br />1. The Last Wish<br />2. Sword of Destiny<br />3. Blood of elves<br />4. Time of contempt<br />5. Baptism of fire<br />6. Tower of Swallows ( will be available in English in May 2016)<br />7. Lady of the lake (probably will be available in English in 2017) As a HUGE Fan of the Witcher games, I'm excited that the complete series is being translated and published in the USA!  The Witcher series is a world of high fantasy, with dwarves, elves, humans, sorcerers, kings, empires, knights, vampires, trolls, a complex plot, and realistic characters.  Although the world is high fantasy, everything in it feels real.  This is no small achievement.<br /><br />Story<br />Geralt and Yennifer continue to look for Ciri, who is now riding with a band of bandits called the Rats.  When news of Ciri's Elder Blood reaches higher powers, the world's elite begin searching for her in an attempt to harness her unique powers for their own goals.  Geralt and Yennifer search out of love, while the others search to expand their power and influence.<br /><br />This book focuses mostly on Geralt's search as he meets new friends and they explore the war torn borders in search of Ciri.<br /><br />Characters<br />The Witcher series features a unique cast of deep characters with complex motivations.  Geralt is a witcher, a professional monster slayer.  He is not a hero, and he won't kill a troll because the farmers don't feel safe at night.  Geralt will investigate a troll if he is paid, he may let the troll live or die depending on how he feels about the troll in question, then he'll probably spend his money getting drunk or in a brothel; which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast who risks his life on a daily basis.<br /><br />Geralt and Yennifer, a powerful sorceress, are involved in a volatile romantic relationship.  At times they can't stand each other.  At times, she reads his mind.  At times, she manipulates him.  At times, he sleeps with other women...  which is what you'd expect from a monster slaying outcast and a vindictive sorceress.<br /><br />The emperor of Nilfgaard, a group of sorceresses, and a powerful wizard are also searching for Ciri, and employing their spies, assassins, mercenaries, and magic to find her because of her rare and powerful gifts.<br /><br />What makes this series shine is that the characters are deep and complex, but the motivations behind their actions are always clear to the reader.  Nothing is ever done for the sake of good or evil.  Everything is about personal motivation from characters with grey morals.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The translation from Polish to English is excellent.  At no point does this read like a book that was translated from another language.  The writing style is descriptive, the characters are deep, the world is fascinating and built on European Folklore, the action is brutal, and the humor is dry and sarcastic.<br /><br />Action<br />The books are action packed as Geralt and his group battle monsters, soldiers, wizards, fantasy creatures, and the elements themselves on their quest to locate Ciri.  Although, Geralt is a witcher, an extremely deadly fighter, at no point does he feel like a superhero.  The action, although fantastic, is always grounded in reality.<br /><br />Maturity<br />These books feature violence, swearing, sex, and complex plots.  They are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />Overall<br />Game of Thrones is the most similar series, but instead of 4 family bloodlines converging on the Iron Throne, with over 100 side characters, the Witcher series is much more focused.  The southern empire is invading the northern kingdoms, and they're employing elven commandoes, magic, assassins, spies, diplomacy, and treachery to battle the north.  The heroes never really have a bird's eye view of their situation, so they're often caught by surprise when the world changes, and they must battle their way out.<br /><br />If you enjoy these books and love RPG’s, you should definitely give the games a chance.  If you love the games and want to know about the lore that inspired them, you should read these books.<br /><br />If you want authors who write in a similar style, read David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie.\n"
